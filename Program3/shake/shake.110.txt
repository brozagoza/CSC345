LET US MAKE HEAD  IT WAS YOUR PRESURMISE
THAT IN THE DOLE OF BLOWS YOUR SON MIGHT DROP
YOU KNEW HE WALKD OER PERILS ON AN EDGE
MORE LIKELY TO FALL IN THAN TO GET OER
YOU WERE ADVISED HIS FLESH WAS CAPABLE
OF WOUNDS AND SCARS AND THAT HIS FORWARD SPIRIT
WOULD LIFT HIM WHERE MOST TRADE OF DANGER RANGED
YET DID YOU SAY GO FORTH AND NONE OF THIS
THOUGH STRONGLY APPREHENDED COULD RESTRAIN
THE STIFFBORNE ACTION WHAT HATH THEN BEFALLEN

WHO WITH A DOUBLE SURETY BINDS HIS FOLLOWERS 
MY LORD YOUR SON HAD ONLY BUT THE CORPSE
BUT SHADOWS AND THE SHOWS OF MEN TO FIGHT
FOR THAT SAME WORD REBELLION DID DIVIDE
THE ACTION OF THEIR BODIES FROM THEIR SOULS
AND THEY DID FIGHT WITH QUEASINESS CONSTRAIND
AS MEN DRINK POTIONS THAT THEIR WEAPONS ONLY
SEEMD ON OUR SIDE BUT FOR THEIR SPIRITS AND SOULS
THIS WORD REBELLION IT HAD FROZE THEM UP
AS FISH ARE IN A POND  BUT NOW THE BISHOP
TURNS INSURRECTION TO RELIGION
SUPPOSED SINCERE AND HOLY IN HIS THOUGHTS
HES FOLLOWED BOTH WITH BODY AND WITH MIND
AND DOTH ENLARGE HIS RISING WITH THE BLOOD
OF FAIR KING RICHARD SCRAPED FROM POMFRET STONES
DERIVES FROM HEAVEN HIS QUARREL AND HIS CAUSE

CAN NO MORE SEPARATE AGE AND COVETOUSNESS THAN A
CAN PART YOUNG LIMBS AND LECHERY BUT THE GOUT
GALLS THE ONE AND THE POX PINCHES THE OTHER AND
SO BOTH THE DEGREES PREVENT MY CURSES  BOY 
SIR
WHAT MONEY IS IN MY PURSE
SEVEN GROATS AND TWO PENCE 
I CAN GET NO REMEDY AGAINST THIS CONSUMPTION OF THE
PURSE BORROWING ONLY LINGERS AND LINGERS IT OUT
BUT THE DISEASE IS INCURABLE  GO BEAR THIS LETTER
TO MY LORD OF LANCASTER THIS TO THE PRINCE THIS
TO THE EARL OF WESTMORELAND AND THIS TO OLD
MISTRESS URSULA WHOM I HAVE WEEKLY SWORN TO MARRY
SINCE I PERCEIVED THE FIRST WHITE HAIR ON MY CHIN 
ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME 
A POX OF THIS GOUT  OR A GOUT OF THIS POX  FOR
THE ONE OR THE OTHER PLAYS THE ROGUE WITH MY GREAT
TOE  TIS NO MATTER IF I DO HALT I HAVE THE WARS
FOR MY COLOUR AND MY PENSION SHALL SEEM THE MORE
REASONABLE  A GOOD WIT WILL MAKE USE OF ANY THING
I WILL TURN DISEASES TO COMMODITY 
THUS HAVE YOU HEARD OUR CAUSE AND KNOWN OUR MEANS
AND MY MOST NOBLE FRIENDS I PRAY YOU ALL
SPEAK PLAINLY YOUR OPINIONS OF OUR HOPES
AND FIRST LORD MARSHAL WHAT SAY YOU TO IT
I WELL ALLOW THE OCCASION OF OUR ARMS
BUT GLADLY WOULD BE BETTER SATISFIED
HOW IN OUR MEANS WE SHOULD ADVANCE OURSELVES
TO LOOK WITH FOREHEAD BOLD AND BIG ENOUGH
UPON THE POWER AND PUISSANCE OF THE KING 
OUR PRESENT MUSTERS GROW UPON THE FILE
TO FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND MEN OF CHOICE
AND OUR SUPPLIES LIVE LARGELY IN THE HOPE
OF GREAT NORTHUMBERLAND WHOSE BOSOM BURNS
WITH AN INCENSED FIRE OF INJURIES 
THE QUESTION THEN LORD HASTINGS STANDETH THUS
WHETHER OUR PRESENT FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND
MAY HOLD UP HEAD WITHOUT NORTHUMBERLAND
WITH HIM WE MAY 
YEA MARRY THERES THE POINT
BUT IF WITHOUT HIM WE BE THOUGHT TOO FEEBLE
MY JUDGMENT IS WE SHOULD NOT STEP TOO FAR
TILL WE HAD HIS ASSISTANCE BY THE HAND
FOR IN A THEME SO BLOODYFACED AS THIS
CONJECTURE EXPECTATION AND SURMISE
OF AIDS INCERTAIN SHOULD NOT BE ADMITTED 
TIS VERY TRUE LORD BARDOLPH FOR INDEED
IT WAS YOUNG HOTSPURS CASE AT SHREWSBURY 
IT WAS MY LORD WHO LINED HIMSELF WITH HOPE
EATING THE AIR ON PROMISE OF SUPPLY
FLATTERING HIMSELF IN PROJECT OF A POWER
MUCH SMALLER THAN THE SMALLEST OF HIS THOUGHTS
AND SO WITH GREAT IMAGINATION
PROPER TO MADMEN LED HIS POWERS TO DEATH
AND WINKING LEAPD INTO DESTRUCTION 
BUT BY YOUR LEAVE IT NEVER YET DID HURT
TO LAY DOWN LIKELIHOODS AND FORMS OF HOPE 
YES IF THIS PRESENT QUALITY OF WAR
INDEED THE INSTANT ACTION A CAUSE ON FOOT
LIVES SO IN HOPE AS IN AN EARLY SPRING
WE SEE THE APPEARING BUDS WHICH TO PROVE FRUIT
HOPE GIVES NOT SO MUCH WARRANT AS DESPAIR
THAT FROSTS WILL BITE THEM  WHEN WE MEAN TO BUILD
WE FIRST SURVEY THE PLOT THEN DRAW THE MODEL
AND WHEN WE SEE THE FIGURE OF THE HOUSE
THEN MUST WE RATE THE COST OF THE ERECTION
WHICH IF WE FIND OUTWEIGHS ABILITY
WHAT DO WE THEN BUT DRAW ANEW THE MODEL
IN FEWER OFFICES OR AT LAST DESIST
TO BUILD AT ALL MUCH MORE IN THIS GREAT WORK
WHICH IS ALMOST TO PLUCK A KINGDOM DOWN
AND SET ANOTHER UP SHOULD WE SURVEY
THE PLOT OF SITUATION AND THE MODEL
CONSENT UPON A SURE FOUNDATION
QUESTION SURVEYORS KNOW OUR OWN ESTATE
HOW ABLE SUCH A WORK TO UNDERGO
TO WEIGH AGAINST HIS OPPOSITE OR ELSE
WE FORTIFY IN PAPER AND IN FIGURES
USING THE NAMES OF MEN INSTEAD OF MEN
LIKE ONE THAT DRAWS THE MODEL OF A HOUSE
BEYOND HIS POWER TO BUILD IT WHO HALF THROUGH
GIVES OER AND LEAVES HIS PARTCREATED COST
A NAKED SUBJECT TO THE WEEPING CLOUDS
AND WASTE FOR CHURLISH WINTERS TYRANNY 
GRANT THAT OUR HOPES YET LIKELY OF FAIR BIRTH
SHOULD BE STILLBORN AND THAT WE NOW POSSESSD
THE UTMOST MAN OF EXPECTATION
I THINK WE ARE A BODY STRONG ENOUGH
EVEN AS WE ARE TO EQUAL WITH THE KING 
WHAT IS THE KING BUT FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND
TO US NO MORE NAY NOT SO MUCH LORD BARDOLPH 
FOR HIS DIVISIONS AS THE TIMES DO BRAWL
ARE IN THREE HEADS ONE POWER AGAINST THE FRENCH
AND ONE AGAINST GLENDOWER PERFORCE A THIRD
MUST TAKE UP US SO IS THE UNFIRM KING
IN THREE DIVIDED AND HIS COFFERS SOUND
WITH HOLLOW POVERTY AND EMPTINESS 
THAT HE SHOULD DRAW HIS SEVERAL STRENGTHS TOGETHER
AND COME AGAINST US IN FULL PUISSANCE
NEED NOT BE DREADED 
IF HE SHOULD DO SO
HE LEAVES HIS BACK UNARMD THE FRENCH AND WELSH
BAYING HIM AT THE HEELS NEVER FEAR THAT 
WHO IS IT LIKE SHOULD LEAD HIS FORCES HITHER
THE DUKE OF LANCASTER AND WESTMORELAND
AGAINST THE WELSH HIMSELF AND HARRY MONMOUTH
BUT WHO IS SUBSTITUTED GAINST THE FRENCH
I HAVE NO CERTAIN NOTICE 
LET US ON
AND PUBLISH THE OCCASION OF OUR ARMS 
THE COMMONWEALTH IS SICK OF THEIR OWN CHOICE
THEIR OVERGREEDY LOVE HATH SURFEITED
AN HABITATION GIDDY AND UNSURE
HATH HE THAT BUILDETH ON THE VULGAR HEART 
O THOU FOND MANY WITH WHAT LOUD APPLAUSE
DIDST THOU BEAT HEAVEN WITH BLESSING BOLINGBROKE
BEFORE HE WAS WHAT THOU WOULDST HAVE HIM BE 
AND BEING NOW TRIMMD IN THINE OWN DESIRES

WITH DIVERS LIQUORS  O IF THIS WERE SEEN
THE HAPPIEST YOUTH VIEWING HIS PROGRESS THROUGH

TIS NOT TEN YEARS GONE
SINCE RICHARD AND NORTHUMBERLAND GREAT FRIENDS

MY COUSIN BOLINGBROKE ASCENDS MY THRONE

FIGURING THE NATURE OF THE TIMES DECEASED
THE WHICH OBSERVED A MAN MAY PROPHESY
WITH A NEAR AIM OF THE MAIN CHANCE OF THINGS

SUCH THINGS BECOME THE HATCH AND BROOD OF TIME
AND BY THE NECESSARY FORM OF THIS
KING RICHARD MIGHT CREATE A PERFECT GUESS
THAT GREAT NORTHUMBERLAND THEN FALSE TO HIM
WOULD OF THAT SEED GROW TO A GREATER FALSENESS
WHICH SHOULD NOT FIND A GROUND TO ROOT UPON
UNLESS ON YOU

WHAT IS THIS FOREST CALLD
TIS GAULTREE FOREST ANT SHALL PLEASE YOUR GRACE 
HERE STAND MY LORDS AND SEND DISCOVERERS FORTH
TO KNOW THE NUMBERS OF OUR ENEMIES 
WE HAVE SENT FORTH ALREADY 
TIS WELL DONE 
MY FRIENDS AND BRETHREN IN THESE GREAT AFFAIRS
I MUST ACQUAINT YOU THAT I HAVE RECEIVED
NEWDATED LETTERS FROM NORTHUMBERLAND
THEIR COLD INTENT TENOR AND SUBSTANCE THUS
HERE DOTH HE WISH HIS PERSON WITH SUCH POWERS
AS MIGHT HOLD SORTANCE WITH HIS QUALITY
THE WHICH HE COULD NOT LEVY WHEREUPON
HE IS RETIRED TO RIPE HIS GROWING FORTUNES
TO SCOTLAND AND CONCLUDES IN HEARTY PRAYERS
THAT YOUR ATTEMPTS MAY OVERLIVE THE HAZARD
AND FEARFUL MELTING OF THEIR OPPOSITE 
THUS DO THE HOPES WE HAVE IN HIM TOUCH GROUND
AND DASH THEMSELVES TO PIECES 
NOW WHAT NEWS
WEST OF THIS FOREST SCARCELY OFF A MILE
IN GOODLY FORM COMES ON THE ENEMY
AND BY THE GROUND THEY HIDE I JUDGE THEIR NUMBER
UPON OR NEAR THE RATE OF THIRTY THOUSAND 
THE JUST PROPORTION THAT WE GAVE THEM OUT
LET US SWAY ON AND FACE THEM IN THE FIELD 
WHAT WELLAPPOINTED LEADER FRONTS US HERE
I THINK IT IS MY LORD OF WESTMORELAND 
HEALTH AND FAIR GREETING FROM OUR GENERAL
THE PRINCE LORD JOHN AND DUKE OF LANCASTER 
SAY ON MY LORD OF WESTMORELAND IN PEACE
WHAT DOTH CONCERN YOUR COMING
THEN MY LORD
UNTO YOUR GRACE DO I IN CHIEF ADDRESS
THE SUBSTANCE OF MY SPEECH  IF THAT REBELLION
CAME LIKE ITSELF IN BASE AND ABJECT ROUTS
LED ON BY BLOODY YOUTH GUARDED WITH RAGS
AND COUNTENANCED BY BOYS AND BEGGARY
I SAY IF DAMND COMMOTION SO APPEARD
IN HIS TRUE NATIVE AND MOST PROPER SHAPE
YOU REVEREND FATHER AND THESE NOBLE LORDS
HAD NOT BEEN HERE TO DRESS THE UGLY FORM
OF BASE AND BLOODY INSURRECTION
WITH YOUR FAIR HONOURS  YOU LORD ARCHBISHOP
WHOSE SEE IS BY A CIVIL PEACE MAINTAINED
WHOSE BEARD THE SILVER HAND OF PEACE HATH TOUCHD
WHOSE LEARNING AND GOOD LETTERS PEACE HATH TUTORD
WHOSE WHITE INVESTMENTS FIGURE INNOCENCE
THE DOVE AND VERY BLESSED SPIRIT OF PEACE
WHEREFORE DO YOU SO ILL TRANSLATE OURSELF
OUT OF THE SPEECH OF PEACE THAT BEARS SUCH GRACE
INTO THE HARSH AND BOISTEROUS TONGUE OF WAR
TURNING YOUR BOOKS TO GRAVES YOUR INK TO BLOOD
YOUR PENS TO LANCES AND YOUR TONGUE DIVINE
TO A TRUMPET AND A POINT OF WAR
WHEREFORE DO I THIS SO THE QUESTION STANDS 
BRIEFLY TO THIS END WE ARE ALL DISEASED
AND WITH OUR SURFEITING AND WANTON HOURS
HAVE BROUGHT OURSELVES INTO A BURNING FEVER
AND WE MUST BLEED FOR IT OF WHICH DISEASE
OUR LATE KING RICHARD BEING INFECTED DIED 
BUT MY MOST NOBLE LORD OF WESTMORELAND
I TAKE NOT ON ME HERE AS A PHYSICIAN
NOR DO I AS AN ENEMY TO PEACE
TROOP IN THE THRONGS OF MILITARY MEN
BUT RATHER SHOW AWHILE LIKE FEARFUL WAR
TO DIET RANK MINDS SICK OF HAPPINESS
AND PURGE THE OBSTRUCTIONS WHICH BEGIN TO STOP
OUR VERY VEINS OF LIFE  HEAR ME MORE PLAINLY 
I HAVE IN EQUAL BALANCE JUSTLY WEIGHD
WHAT WRONGS OUR ARMS MAY DO WHAT WRONGS WE SUFFER
AND FIND OUR GRIEFS HEAVIER THAN OUR OFFENCES 
WE SEE WHICH WAY THE STREAM OF TIME DOTH RUN
AND ARE ENFORCED FROM OUR MOST QUIET THERE
BY THE ROUGH TORRENT OF OCCASION
AND HAVE THE SUMMARY OF ALL OUR GRIEFS
WHEN TIME SHALL SERVE TO SHOW IN ARTICLES
WHICH LONG ERE THIS WE OFFERD TO THE KING
AND MIGHT BY NO SUIT GAIN OUR AUDIENCE
WHEN WE ARE WRONGD AND WOULD UNFOLD OUR GRIEFS
WE ARE DENIED ACCESS UNTO HIS PERSON
EVEN BY THOSE MEN THAT MOST HAVE DONE US WRONG 
THE DANGERS OF THE DAYS BUT NEWLY GONE
WHOSE MEMORY IS WRITTEN ON THE EARTH
WITH YET APPEARING BLOOD AND THE EXAMPLES
OF EVERY MINUTES INSTANCE PRESENT NOW
HATH PUT US IN THESE ILLBESEEMING ARMS
NOT TO BREAK PEACE OR ANY BRANCH OF IT
BUT TO ESTABLISH HERE A PEACE INDEED
CONCURRING BOTH IN NAME AND QUALITY 
WHEN EVER YET WAS YOUR APPEAL DENIED
WHEREIN HAVE YOU BEEN GALLED BY THE KING
WHAT PEER HATH BEEN SUBORND TO GRATE ON YOU
THAT YOU SHOULD SEAL THIS LAWLESS BLOODY BOOK
OF FORGED REBELLION WITH A SEAL DIVINE
AND CONSECRATE COMMOTIONS BITTER EDGE
MY BROTHER GENERAL THE COMMONWEALTH
TO BROTHER BORN AN HOUSEHOLD CRUELTY
I MAKE MY QUARREL IN PARTICULAR 
THERE IS NO NEED OF ANY SUCH REDRESS
OR IF THERE WERE IT NOT BELONGS TO YOU 
WHY NOT TO HIM IN PART AND TO US ALL
THAT FEEL THE BRUISES OF THE DAYS BEFORE
AND SUFFER THE CONDITION OF THESE TIMES
TO LAY A HEAVY AND UNEQUAL HAND
UPON OUR HONOURS
O MY GOOD LORD MOWBRAY
CONSTRUE THE TIMES TO THEIR NECESSITIES
AND YOU SHALL SAY INDEED IT IS THE TIME
AND NOT THE KING THAT DOTH YOU INJURIES 
YET FOR YOUR PART IT NOT APPEARS TO ME
EITHER FROM THE KING OR IN THE PRESENT TIME
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE AN INCH OF ANY GROUND
TO BUILD A GRIEF ON WERE YOU NOT RESTORED
TO ALL THE DUKE OF NORFOLKS SIGNORIES
YOUR NOBLE AND RIGHT WELL REMEMBERD FATHERS
WHAT THING IN HONOUR HAD MY FATHER LOST
THAT NEED TO BE REVIVED AND BREATHED IN ME
THE KING THAT LOVED HIM AS THE STATE STOOD THEN
WAS FORCE PERFORCE COMPELLD TO BANISH HIM
AND THEN THAT HARRY BOLINGBROKE AND HE
BEING MOUNTED AND BOTH ROUSED IN THEIR SEATS
THEIR NEIGHING COURSERS DARING OF THE SPUR
THEIR ARMED STAVES IN CHARGE THEIR BEAVERS DOWN
THEIR EYES OF FIRE SPARKING THROUGH SIGHTS OF STEEL
AND THE LOUD TRUMPET BLOWING THEM TOGETHER
THEN THEN WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING COULD HAVE STAYD
MY FATHER FROM THE BREAST OF BOLINGBROKE
O WHEN THE KING DID THROW HIS WARDER DOWN
HIS OWN LIFE HUNG UPON THE STAFF HE THREW
THEN THREW HE DOWN HIMSELF AND ALL THEIR LIVES
THAT BY INDICTMENT AND BY DINT OF SWORD
HAVE SINCE MISCARRIED UNDER BOLINGBROKE 
YOU SPEAK LORD MOWBRAY NOW YOU KNOW NOT WHAT 
THE EARL OF HEREFORD WAS REPUTED THEN
IN ENGLAND THE MOST VALIANT GENTLEMEN
WHO KNOWS ON WHOM FORTUNE WOULD THEN HAVE SMILED
BUT IF YOUR FATHER HAD BEEN VICTOR THERE
HE NEER HAD BORNE IT OUT OF COVENTRY
FOR ALL THE COUNTRY IN A GENERAL VOICE
CRIED HATE UPON HIM AND ALL THEIR PRAYERS AND LOVE
WERE SET ON HEREFORD WHOM THEY DOTED ON
AND BLESSD AND GRACED INDEED MORE THAN THE KING 
BUT THIS IS MERE DIGRESSION FROM MY PURPOSE

BUT HE HATH FORCED US TO COMPEL THIS OFFER
AND IT PROCEEDS FROM POLICY NOT LOVE 
MOWBRAY YOU OVERWEEN TO TAKE IT SO
THIS OFFER COMES FROM MERCY NOT FROM FEAR
FOR LO  WITHIN A KEN OUR ARMY LIES
UPON MINE HONOUR ALL TOO CONFIDENT
TO GIVE ADMITTANCE TO A THOUGHT OF FEAR 
OUR BATTLE IS MORE FULL OF NAMES THAN YOURS
OUR MEN MORE PERFECT IN THE USE OF ARMS
OUR ARMOUR ALL AS STRONG OUR CAUSE THE BEST
THEN REASON WILL OUR HEART SHOULD BE AS GOOD
SAY YOU NOT THEN OUR OFFER IS COMPELLD 
WELL BY MY WILL WE SHALL ADMIT NO PARLEY 
THAT ARGUES BUT THE SHAME OF YOUR OFFENCE
A ROTTEN CASE ABIDES NO HANDLING 
HATH THE PRINCE JOHN A FULL COMMISSION
IN VERY AMPLE VIRTUE OF HIS FATHER
TO HEAR AND ABSOLUTELY TO DETERMINE
OF WHAT CONDITIONS WE SHALL STAND UPON
THAT IS INTENDED IN THE GENERALS NAME
I MUSE YOU MAKE SO SLIGHT A QUESTION 
THEN TAKE MY LORD OF WESTMORELAND THIS SCHEDULE
FOR THIS CONTAINS OUR GENERAL GRIEVANCES
EACH SEVERAL ARTICLE HEREIN REDRESSD
ALL MEMBERS OF OUR CAUSE BOTH HERE AND HENCE

AND EITHER END IN PEACE WHICH GOD SO FRAME 
OR TO THE PLACE OF DIFFERENCE CALL THE SWORDS
WHICH MUST DECIDE IT 
MY LORD WE WILL DO SO 
THERE IS A THING WITHIN MY BOSOM TELLS ME
THAT NO CONDITIONS OF OUR PEACE CAN STAND 
FEAR YOU NOT THAT IF WE CAN MAKE OUR PEACE

THAT EVEN OUR CORN SHALL SEEM AS LIGHT AS CHAFF
AND GOOD FROM BAD FIND NO PARTITION 
NO NO MY LORD  NOTE THIS THE KING IS WEARY
OF DAINTY AND SUCH PICKING GRIEVANCES
FOR HE HATH FOUND TO END ONE DOUBT BY DEATH
REVIVES TWO GREATER IN THE HEIRS OF LIFE
AND THEREFORE WILL HE WIPE HIS TABLES CLEAN
AND KEEP NO TELLTALE TO HIS MEMORY
THAT MAY REPEAT AND HISTORY HIS LOSS
TO NEW REMEMBRANCE FOR FULL WELL HE KNOWS
HE CANNOT SO PRECISELY WEED THIS LAND
AS HIS MISDOUBTS PRESENT OCCASION
HIS FOES ARE SO ENROOTED WITH HIS FRIENDS
THAT PLUCKING TO UNFIX AN ENEMY
HE DOTH UNFASTEN SO AND SHAKE A FRIEND
SO THAT THIS LAND LIKE AN OFFENSIVE WIFE
THAT HATH ENRAGED HIM ON TO OFFER STROKES
AS HE IS STRIKING HOLDS HIS INFANT UP
AND HANGS RESOLVED CORRECTION IN THE ARM
THAT WAS UPREARD TO EXECUTION 
BESIDES THE KING HATH WASTED ALL HIS RODS
ON LATE OFFENDERS THAT HE NOW DOTH LACK

DELECTABLE SHAPES WHICH DELIVERED OER TO THE

EXCELLENT WIT  THE SECOND PROPERTY OF YOUR
EXCELLENT SHERRIS IS THE WARMING OF THE BLOOD
WHICH BEFORE COLD AND SETTLED LEFT THE LIVER
WHITE AND PALE WHICH IS THE BADGE OF PUSILLANIMITY

HUMPHREY MY SON OF GLOUCESTER
WHERE IS THE PRINCE YOUR BROTHER
I THINK HES GONE TO HUNT MY LORD AT WINDSOR 
AND HOW ACCOMPANIED
I DO NOT KNOW MY LORD

THOU HAST A BETTER PLACE IN HIS AFFECTION
THAN ALL THY BROTHERS CHERISH IT MY BOY
AND NOBLE OFFICES THOU MAYST EFFECT
OF MEDIATION AFTER I AM DEAD
BETWEEN HIS GREATNESS AND THY OTHER BRETHREN
THEREFORE OMIT HIM NOT BLUNT NOT HIS LOVE
NOR LOSE THE GOOD ADVANTAGE OF HIS GRACE
BY SEEMING COLD OR CARELESS OF HIS WILL
FOR HE IS GRACIOUS IF HE BE OBSERVED
HE HATH A TEAR FOR PITY AND A HAND
OPEN AS DAY FOR MELTING CHARITY
YET NOTWITHSTANDING BEING INCENSED HES FLINT
AS HUMOROUS AS WINTER AND AS SUDDEN
AS FLAWS CONGEALED IN THE SPRING OF DAY 
HIS TEMPER THEREFORE MUST BE WELL OBSERVED
CHIDE HIM FOR FAULTS AND DO IT REVERENTLY
WHEN THOU PERCEIVE HIS BLOOD INCLINED TO MIRTH
BUT BEING MOODY GIVE HIM LINE AND SCOPE
TILL THAT HIS PASSIONS LIKE A WHALE ON GROUND
CONFOUND THEMSELVES WITH WORKING  LEARN THIS THOMAS

MINGLED WITH VENOM OF SUGGESTION 
AS FORCE PERFORCE THE AGE WILL POUR IT IN 
SHALL NEVER LEAK THOUGH IT DO WORK AS STRONG
AS ACONITUM OR RASH GUNPOWDER 
I SHALL OBSERVE HIM WITH ALL CARE AND LOVE 
WHY ART THOU NOT AT WINDSOR WITH HIM THOMAS

AND HOW ACCOMPANIED CANST THOU TELL THAT
WITH POINS AND OTHER HIS CONTINUAL FOLLOWERS 
MOST SUBJECT IS THE FATTEST SOIL TO WEEDS
AND HE THE NOBLE IMAGE OF MY YOUTH
IS OVERSPREAD WITH THEM THEREFORE MY GRIEF
STRETCHES ITSELF BEYOND THE HOUR OF DEATH
THE BLOOD WEEPS FROM MY HEART WHEN I DO SHAPE
IN FORMS IMAGINARY THE UNGUIDED DAYS
AND ROTTEN TIMES THAT YOU SHALL LOOK UPON
WHEN I AM SLEEPING WITH MY ANCESTORS 
FOR WHEN HIS HEADSTRONG RIOT HATH NO CURB
WHEN RAGE AND HOT BLOOD ARE HIS COUNSELLORS
WHEN MEANS AND LAVISH MANNERS MEET TOGETHER
O WITH WHAT WINGS SHALL HIS AFFECTIONS FLY
TOWARDS FRONTING PERIL AND OPPOSED DECAY 
MY GRACIOUS LORD YOU LOOK BEYOND HIM QUITE
THE PRINCE BUT STUDIES HIS COMPANIONS
LIKE A STRANGE TONGUE WHEREIN TO GAIN THE LANGUAGE
TIS NEEDFUL THAT THE MOST IMMODEST WORD
BE LOOKD UPON AND LEARND WHICH ONCE ATTAIND

PRESERVING LIFE IN MEDICINE POTABLE
BUT THOU MOST FINE MOST HONOURD MOST RENOWND
HAST EAT THY BEARER UP  THUS MY MOST ROYAL LIEGE
ACCUSING IT I PUT IT ON MY HEAD
TO TRY WITH IT AS WITH AN ENEMY
THAT HAD BEFORE MY FACE MURDERD MY FATHER
THE QUARREL OF A TRUE INHERITOR 
BUT IF IT DID INFECT MY BLOOD WITH JOY
OR SWELL MY THOUGHTS TO ANY STRAIN OF PRIDE
IF ANY REBEL OR VAIN SPIRIT OF MINE
DID WITH THE LEAST AFFECTION OF A WELCOME
GIVE ENTERTAINMENT TO THE MIGHT OF IT
LET GOD FOR EVER KEEP IT FROM MY HEAD
AND MAKE ME AS THE POOREST VASSAL IS
THAT DOTH WITH AWE AND TERROR KNEEL TO IT 
O MY SON
GOD PUT IT IN THY MIND TO TAKE IT HENCE
THAT THOU MIGHTST WIN THE MORE THY FATHERS LOVE
PLEADING SO WISELY IN EXCUSE OF IT 
COME HITHER HARRY SIT THOU BY MY BED
AND HEAR I THINK THE VERY LATEST COUNSEL
THAT EVER I SHALL BREATHE  GOD KNOWS MY SON
BY WHAT BYPATHS AND INDIRECT CROOKD WAYS
I MET THIS CROWN AND I MYSELF KNOW WELL
HOW TROUBLESOME IT SAT UPON MY HEAD 
TO THEE IT SHALL DESCEND WITH BITTER QUIET
BETTER OPINION BETTER CONFIRMATION
FOR ALL THE SOIL OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GOES
WITH ME INTO THE EARTH  IT SEEMD IN ME
BUT AS AN HONOUR SNATCHD WITH BOISTEROUS HAND
AND I HAD MANY LIVING TO UPBRAID
MY GAIN OF IT BY THEIR ASSISTANCES
WHICH DAILY GREW TO QUARREL AND TO BLOODSHED
WOUNDING SUPPOSED PEACE ALL THESE BOLD FEARS
THOU SEEST WITH PERIL I HAVE ANSWERED
FOR ALL MY REIGN HATH BEEN BUT AS A SCENE
ACTING THAT ARGUMENT AND NOW MY DEATH
CHANGES THE MODE FOR WHAT IN ME WAS PURCHASED
FALLS UPON THEE IN A MORE FAIRER SORT
SO THOU THE GARLAND WEARST SUCCESSIVELY 
YET THOUGH THOU STANDST MORE SURE THAN I COULD DO
THOU ART NOT FIRM ENOUGH SINCE GRIEFS ARE GREEN
AND ALL MY FRIENDS WHICH THOU MUST MAKE THY FRIENDS
HAVE BUT THEIR STINGS AND TEETH NEWLY TAEN OUT
BY WHOSE FELL WORKING I WAS FIRST ADVANCED
AND BY WHOSE POWER I WELL MIGHT LODGE A FEAR
TO BE AGAIN DISPLACED WHICH TO AVOID
I CUT THEM OFF AND HAD A PURPOSE NOW
TO LEAD OUT MANY TO THE HOLY LAND
LEST REST AND LYING STILL MIGHT MAKE THEM LOOK
TOO NEAR UNTO MY STATE  THEREFORE MY HARRY
BE IT THY COURSE TO BUSY GIDDY MINDS
WITH FOREIGN QUARRELS THAT ACTION HENCE BORNE OUT
MAY WASTE THE MEMORY OF THE FORMER DAYS 
MORE WOULD I BUT MY LUNGS ARE WASTED SO
THAT STRENGTH OF SPEECH IS UTTERLY DENIED ME 
HOW I CAME BY THE CROWN O GOD FORGIVE
AND GRANT IT MAY WITH THEE IN TRUE PEACE LIVE 
MY GRACIOUS LIEGE
YOU WON IT WORE IT KEPT IT GAVE IT ME
THEN PLAIN AND RIGHT MUST MY POSSESSION BE
WHICH I WITH MORE THAN WITH A COMMON PAIN
GAINST ALL THE WORLD WILL RIGHTFULLY MAINTAIN 
LOOK LOOK HERE COMES MY JOHN OF LANCASTER 
HEALTH PEACE AND HAPPINESS TO MY ROYAL FATHER 
THOU BRINGST ME HAPPINESS AND PEACE SON JOHN
BUT HEALTH ALACK WITH YOUTHFUL WINGS IS FLOWN
FROM THIS BARE WITHERD TRUNK UPON THY SIGHT
MY WORLDLY BUSINESS MAKES A PERIOD 
WHERE IS MY LORD OF WARWICK
MY LORD OF WARWICK 
DOTH ANY NAME PARTICULAR BELONG
UNTO THE LODGING WHERE I FIRST DID SWOON
TIS CALLD JERUSALEM MY NOBLE LORD 
LAUD BE TO GOD  EVEN THERE MY LIFE MUST END

I THEN DID USE THE PERSON OF YOUR FATHER
THE IMAGE OF HIS POWER LAY THEN IN ME
AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HIS LAW
WHILES I WAS BUSY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH
YOUR HIGHNESS PLEASED TO FORGET MY PLACE
THE MAJESTY AND POWER OF LAW AND JUSTICE
THE IMAGE OF THE KING WHOM I PRESENTED
AND STRUCK ME IN MY VERY SEAT OF JUDGMENT
WHEREON AS AN OFFENDER TO YOUR FATHER
I GAVE BOLD WAY TO MY AUTHORITY
AND DID COMMIT YOU  IF THE DEED WERE ILL
BE YOU CONTENTED WEARING NOW THE GARLAND
TO HAVE A SON SET YOUR DECREES AT NOUGHT
TO PLUCK DOWN JUSTICE FROM YOUR AWFUL BENCH
TO TRIP THE COURSE OF LAW AND BLUNT THE SWORD
THAT GUARDS THE PEACE AND SAFETY OF YOUR PERSON
NAY MORE TO SPURN AT YOUR MOST ROYAL IMAGE
AND MOCK YOUR WORKINGS IN A SECOND BODY 
QUESTION YOUR ROYAL THOUGHTS MAKE THE CASE YOURS
BE NOW THE FATHER AND PROPOSE A SON
HEAR YOUR OWN DIGNITY SO MUCH PROFANED
SEE YOUR MOST DREADFUL LAWS SO LOOSELY SLIGHTED
BEHOLD YOURSELF SO BY A SON DISDAIND
AND THEN IMAGINE ME TAKING YOUR PART
AND IN YOUR POWER SOFT SILENCING YOUR SON
AFTER THIS COLD CONSIDERANCE SENTENCE ME
AND AS YOU ARE A KING SPEAK IN YOUR STATE
WHAT I HAVE DONE THAT MISBECAME MY PLACE
MY PERSON OR MY LIEGES SOVEREIGNTY

THEREFORE STILL BEAR THE BALANCE AND THE SWORD
AND I DO WISH YOUR HONOURS MAY INCREASE
TILL YOU DO LIVE TO SEE A SON OF MINE
OFFEND YOU AND OBEY YOU AS I DID 
SO SHALL I LIVE TO SPEAK MY FATHERS WORDS
HAPPY AM I THAT HAVE A MAN SO BOLD
THAT DARES DO JUSTICE ON MY PROPER SON
AND NOT LESS HAPPY HAVING SUCH A SON
THAT WOULD DELIVER UP HIS GREATNESS SO
INTO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE  YOU DID COMMIT ME
FOR WHICH I DO COMMIT INTO YOUR HAND
THE UNSTAINED SWORD THAT YOU HAVE USED TO BEAR
WITH THIS REMEMBRANCE THAT YOU USE THE SAME
WITH THE LIKE BOLD JUST AND IMPARTIAL SPIRIT
AS YOU HAVE DONE GAINST ME  THERE IS MY HAND

MY VOICE SHALL SOUND AS YOU DO PROMPT MINE EAR
AND I WILL STOOP AND HUMBLE MY INTENTS
TO YOUR WELLPRACTISED WISE DIRECTIONS 
AND PRINCES ALL BELIEVE ME I BESEECH YOU
MY FATHER IS GONE WILD INTO HIS GRAVE
FOR IN HIS TOMB LIE MY AFFECTIONS
AND WITH HIS SPIRIT SADLY I SURVIVE
TO MOCK THE EXPECTATION OF THE WORLD

ROTTEN OPINION WHO HATH WRIT ME DOWN
AFTER MY SEEMING  THE TIDE OF BLOOD IN ME
