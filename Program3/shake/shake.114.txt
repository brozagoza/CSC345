GOOD MORROW AND WELL MET  HOW HAVE YE DONE
SINCE LAST WE SAW IN FRANCE
I THANK YOUR GRACE
HEALTHFUL AND EVER SINCE A FRESH ADMIRER
OF WHAT I SAW THERE 
AN UNTIMELY AGUE
STAYD ME A PRISONER IN MY CHAMBER WHEN
THOSE SUNS OF GLORY THOSE TWO LIGHTS OF MEN
MET IN THE VALE OF ANDREN 
TWIXT GUYNES AND ARDE
I WAS THEN PRESENT SAW THEM SALUTE ON HORSEBACK
BEHELD THEM WHEN THEY LIGHTED HOW THEY CLUNG
IN THEIR EMBRACEMENT AS THEY GREW TOGETHER
WHICH HAD THEY WHAT FOUR THRONED ONES COULD HAVE WEIGHD
SUCH A COMPOUNDED ONE
ALL THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS MY CHAMBERS PRISONER 
THEN YOU LOST
THE VIEW OF EARTHLY GLORY MEN MIGHT SAY
TILL THIS TIME POMP WAS SINGLE BUT NOW MARRIED
TO ONE ABOVE ITSELF  EACH FOLLOWING DAY
BECAME THE NEXT DAYS MASTER TILL THE LAST
MADE FORMER WONDERS ITS  TODAY THE FRENCH
ALL CLINQUANT ALL IN GOLD LIKE HEATHEN GODS
SHONE DOWN THE ENGLISH AND TOMORROW THEY
MADE BRITAIN INDIA EVERY MAN THAT STOOD
SHOWD LIKE A MINE  THEIR DWARFISH PAGES WERE
AS CHERUBINS ALL GUILT THE MADAMS TOO
NOT USED TO TOIL DID ALMOST SWEAT TO BEAR
THE PRIDE UPON THEM THAT THEIR VERY LABOUR
WAS TO THEM AS A PAINTING NOW THIS MASQUE
WAS CRIED INCOMPARABLE AND THE ENSUING NIGHT
MADE IT A FOOL AND BEGGAR  THE TWO KINGS
EQUAL IN LUSTRE WERE NOW BEST NOW WORST
AS PRESENCE DID PRESENT THEM HIM IN EYE
STILL HIM IN PRAISE AND BEING PRESENT BOTH
TWAS SAID THEY SAW BUT ONE AND NO DISCERNER
DURST WAG HIS TONGUE IN CENSURE  WHEN THESE SUNS 
FOR SO THEY PHRASE EM BY THEIR HERALDS CHALLENGED
THE NOBLE SPIRITS TO ARMS THEY DID PERFORM
BEYOND THOUGHTS COMPASS THAT FORMER FABULOUS STORY
BEING NOW SEEN POSSIBLE ENOUGH GOT CREDIT
THAT BEVIS WAS BELIEVED 
O YOU GO FAR 
AS I BELONG TO WORSHIP AND AFFECT
IN HONOUR HONESTY THE TRACT OF EVERY THING
WOULD BY A GOOD DISCOURSER LOSE SOME LIFE
WHICH ACTIONS SELF WAS TONGUE TO  ALL WAS ROYAL
TO THE DISPOSING OF IT NOUGHT REBELLD 
ORDER GAVE EACH THING VIEW THE OFFICE DID
DISTINCTLY HIS FULL FUNCTION 
WHO DID GUIDE
I MEAN WHO SET THE BODY AND THE LIMBS
OF THIS GREAT SPORT TOGETHER AS YOU GUESS
ONE CERTES THAT PROMISES NO ELEMENT
IN SUCH A BUSINESS 
I PRAY YOU WHO MY LORD
ALL THIS WAS ORDERD BY THE GOOD DISCRETION
OF THE RIGHT REVEREND CARDINAL OF YORK 
THE DEVIL SPEED HIM  NO MANS PIE IS FREED
FROM HIS AMBITIOUS FINGER  WHAT HAD HE
TO DO IN THESE FIERCE VANITIES I WONDER
THAT SUCH A KEECH CAN WITH HIS VERY BULK
TAKE UP THE RAYS O THE BENEFICIAL SUN
AND KEEP IT FROM THE EARTH 
SURELY SIR
THERES IN HIM STUFF THAT PUTS HIM TO THESE ENDS
FOR BEING NOT PROPPD BY ANCESTRY WHOSE GRACE
CHALKS SUCCESSORS THEIR WAY NOR CALLD UPON
FOR HIGH FEATS DONE TO THE CROWN NEITHER ALLIED
FOR EMINENT ASSISTANTS BUT SPIDERLIKE
OUT OF HIS SELFDRAWING WEB HE GIVES US NOTE
THE FORCE OF HIS OWN MERIT MAKES HIS WAY
A GIFT THAT HEAVEN GIVES FOR HIM WHICH BUYS
A PLACE NEXT TO THE KING 
I CANNOT TELL
WHAT HEAVEN HATH GIVEN HIM LET SOME GRAVER EYE
PIERCE INTO THAT BUT I CAN SEE HIS PRIDE
PEEP THROUGH EACH PART OF HIM WHENCE HAS HE THAT
IF NOT FROM HELL THE DEVIL IS A NIGGARD
OR HAS GIVEN ALL BEFORE AND HE BEGINS
A NEW HELL IN HIMSELF 
WHY THE DEVIL
UPON THIS FRENCH GOING OUT TOOK HE UPON HIM
WITHOUT THE PRIVITY O THE KING TO APPOINT
WHO SHOULD ATTEND ON HIM HE MAKES UP THE FILE
OF ALL THE GENTRY FOR THE MOST PART SUCH
TO WHOM AS GREAT A CHARGE AS LITTLE HONOUR
HE MEANT TO LAY UPON AND HIS OWN LETTER
THE HONOURABLE BOARD OF COUNCIL OUT
MUST FETCH HIM IN THE PAPERS 
I DO KNOW
KINSMEN OF MINE THREE AT THE LEAST THAT HAVE
BY THIS SO SICKENED THEIR ESTATES THAT NEVER
THEY SHALL ABOUND AS FORMERLY 
O MANY
HAVE BROKE THEIR BACKS WITH LAYING MANORS ON EM
FOR THIS GREAT JOURNEY  WHAT DID THIS VANITY
BUT MINISTER COMMUNICATION OF
A MOST POOR ISSUE
GRIEVINGLY I THINK
THE PEACE BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND US NOT VALUES
THE COST THAT DID CONCLUDE IT 
EVERY MAN
AFTER THE HIDEOUS STORM THAT FOLLOWD WAS
A THING INSPIRED AND NOT CONSULTING BROKE
INTO A GENERAL PROPHECY THAT THIS TEMPEST
DASHING THE GARMENT OF THIS PEACE ABODED
THE SUDDEN BREACH ONT 
WHICH IS BUDDED OUT
FOR FRANCE HATH FLAWD THE LEAGUE AND HATH ATTACHD
OUR MERCHANTS GOODS AT BOURDEAUX 
IS IT THEREFORE
THE AMBASSADOR IS SILENCED
MARRY IST 
A PROPER TITLE OF A PEACE AND PURCHASED
AT A SUPERFLUOUS RATE 
WHY ALL THIS BUSINESS
OUR REVEREND CARDINAL CARRIED 
LIKE IT YOUR GRACE
THE STATE TAKES NOTICE OF THE PRIVATE DIFFERENCE
BETWIXT YOU AND THE CARDINAL  I ADVISE YOU 
AND TAKE IT FROM A HEART THAT WISHES TOWARDS YOU
HONOUR AND PLENTEOUS SAFETY THAT YOU READ
THE CARDINALS MALICE AND HIS POTENCY
TOGETHER TO CONSIDER FURTHER THAT
WHAT HIS HIGH HATRED WOULD EFFECT WANTS NOT
A MINISTER IN HIS POWER  YOU KNOW HIS NATURE
THAT HES REVENGEFUL AND I KNOW HIS SWORD
HATH A SHARP EDGE ITS LONG AND T MAY BE SAID
IT REACHES FAR AND WHERE TWILL NOT EXTEND
THITHER HE DARTS IT  BOSOM UP MY COUNSEL
YOULL FIND IT WHOLESOME  LO WHERE COMES THAT ROCK
THAT I ADVISE YOUR SHUNNING 
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMS SURVEYOR HA
WHERES HIS EXAMINATION
HERE SO PLEASE YOU 
IS HE IN PERSON READY
AY PLEASE YOUR GRACE 
WELL WE SHALL THEN KNOW MORE AND BUCKINGHAM
SHALL LESSEN THIS BIG LOOK 
THIS BUTCHERS CUR IS VENOMMOUTHD AND I
HAVE NOT THE POWER TO MUZZLE HIM THEREFORE BEST
NOT WAKE HIM IN HIS SLUMBER  A BEGGARS BOOK
OUTWORTHS A NOBLES BLOOD 
WHAT ARE YOU CHAFED
ASK GOD FOR TEMPERANCE THATS THE APPLIANCE ONLY
WHICH YOUR DISEASE REQUIRES 
I READ INS LOOKS
MATTER AGAINST ME AND HIS EYE REVILED
ME AS HIS ABJECT OBJECT AT THIS INSTANT
HE BORES ME WITH SOME TRICK HES GONE TO THE KING
ILL FOLLOW AND OUTSTARE HIM 
STAY MY LORD
AND LET YOUR REASON WITH YOUR CHOLER QUESTION
WHAT TIS YOU GO ABOUT TO CLIMB STEEP HILLS
REQUIRES SLOW PACE AT FIRST ANGER IS LIKE
A FULLHOT HORSE WHO BEING ALLOWD HIS WAY
SELFMETTLE TIRES HIM  NOT A MAN IN ENGLAND
CAN ADVISE ME LIKE YOU BE TO YOURSELF
AS YOU WOULD TO YOUR FRIEND 
ILL TO THE KING
AND FROM A MOUTH OF HONOUR QUITE CRY DOWN
THIS IPSWICH FELLOWS INSOLENCE OR PROCLAIM
THERES DIFFERENCE IN NO PERSONS 
BE ADVISED
HEAT NOT A FURNACE FOR YOUR FOE SO HOT
THAT IT DO SINGE YOURSELF WE MAY OUTRUN
BY VIOLENT SWIFTNESS THAT WHICH WE RUN AT
AND LOSE BY OVERRUNNING  KNOW YOU NOT
THE FIRE THAT MOUNTS THE LIQUOR TIL RUN OER
IN SEEMING TO AUGMENT IT WASTES IT BE ADVISED
I SAY AGAIN THERE IS NO ENGLISH SOUL
MORE STRONGER TO DIRECT YOU THAN YOURSELF
IF WITH THE SAP OF REASON YOU WOULD QUENCH
OR BUT ALLAY THE FIRE OF PASSION 
SIR
I AM THANKFUL TO YOU AND ILL GO ALONG
BY YOUR PRESCRIPTION BUT THIS TOPPROUD FELLOW
WHOM FROM THE FLOW OF GALL I NAME NOT BUT
FROM SINCERE MOTIONS BY INTELLIGENCE
AND PROOFS AS CLEAR AS FOUNTS IN JULY WHEN
WE SEE EACH GRAIN OF GRAVEL I DO KNOW
TO BE CORRUPT AND TREASONOUS 
SAY NOT TREASONOUS 
TO THE KING ILL SAYT AND MAKE MY VOUCH AS STRONG
AS SHORE OF ROCK  ATTEND  THIS HOLY FOX
OR WOLF OR BOTH FOR HE IS EQUAL RAVENOUS
AS HE IS SUBTLE AND AS PRONE TO MISCHIEF
AS ABLE TO PERFORMT HIS MIND AND PLACE
INFECTING ONE ANOTHER YEA RECIPROCALLY 
ONLY TO SHOW HIS POMP AS WELL IN FRANCE
AS HERE AT HOME SUGGESTS THE KING OUR MASTER
TO THIS LAST COSTLY TREATY THE INTERVIEW
THAT SWALLOWD SO MUCH TREASURE AND LIKE A GLASS
DID BREAK I THE RINSING 
FAITH AND SO IT DID 
PRAY GIVE ME FAVOUR SIR  THIS CUNNING CARDINAL
THE ARTICLES O THE COMBINATION DREW
AS HIMSELF PLEASED AND THEY WERE RATIFIED
AS HE CRIED THUS LET BE TO AS MUCH END
AS GIVE A CRUTCH TO THE DEAD BUT OUR COUNTCARDINAL
HAS DONE THIS AND TIS WELL FOR WORTHY WOLSEY
WHO CANNOT ERR HE DID IT  NOW THIS FOLLOWS 
WHICH AS I TAKE IT IS A KIND OF PUPPY
TO THE OLD DAM TREASON CHARLES THE EMPEROR
UNDER PRETENCE TO SEE THE QUEEN HIS AUNT 
FOR TWAS INDEED HIS COLOUR BUT HE CAME
TO WHISPER WOLSEY HERE MAKES VISITATION
HIS FEARS WERE THAT THE INTERVIEW BETWIXT
ENGLAND AND FRANCE MIGHT THROUGH THEIR AMITY
BREED HIM SOME PREJUDICE FOR FROM THIS LEAGUE
PEEPD HARMS THAT MENACED HIM HE PRIVILY
DEALS WITH OUR CARDINAL AND AS I TROW 
WHICH I DO WELL FOR I AM SURE THE EMPEROR
PAID ERE HE PROMISED WHEREBY HIS SUIT WAS GRANTED
ERE IT WAS ASKD BUT WHEN THE WAY WAS MADE
AND PAVED WITH GOLD THE EMPEROR THUS DESIRED
THAT HE WOULD PLEASE TO ALTER THE KINGS COURSE
AND BREAK THE FORESAID PEACE  LET THE KING KNOW
AS SOON HE SHALL BY ME THAT THUS THE CARDINAL
DOES BUY AND SELL HIS HONOUR AS HE PLEASES
AND FOR HIS OWN ADVANTAGE 
I AM SORRY
TO HEAR THIS OF HIM AND COULD WISH HE WERE
SOMETHING MISTAKEN INT 
NO NOT A SYLLABLE

HE SHALL APPEAR IN PROOF 
YOUR OFFICE SERGEANT EXECUTE IT

HOW KNOWST THOU THIS
NOT LONG BEFORE YOUR HIGHNESS SPED TO FRANCE

CONCERNING THE FRENCH JOURNEY I REPLIED
MEN FEARD THE FRENCH WOULD PROVE PERFIDIOUS

AS TO THE TOWER I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE PLAYD
THE PART MY FATHER MEANT TO ACT UPON
THE USURPER RICHARD WHO BEING AT SALISBURY
MADE SUIT TO COME INS PRESENCE WHICH IF GRANTED
AS HE MADE SEMBLANCE OF HIS DUTY WOULD
HAVE PUT HIS KNIFE TO HIM 
A GIANT TRAITOR 
NOW MADAM MAY HIS HIGHNESS LIVE IN FREEDOM
AND THIS MAN OUT OF PRISON
GOD MEND ALL 
THERES SOMETHING MORE WOULD OUT OF THEE WHAT SAYST
AFTER THE DUKE HIS FATHER WITH THE KNIFE
HE STRETCHD HIM AND WITH ONE HAND ON HIS DAGGER

THERES HIS PERIOD
TO SHEATHE HIS KNIFE IN US  HE IS ATTACHD
CALL HIM TO PRESENT TRIAL IF HE MAY
FIND MERCY IN THE LAW TIS HIS IF NONE
LET HIM NOT SEEK T OF US BY DAY AND NIGHT
HES TRAITOR TO THE HEIGHT 
IST POSSIBLE THE SPELLS OF FRANCE SHOULD JUGGLE
MEN INTO SUCH STRANGE MYSTERIES
NEW CUSTOMS

NAY LET EM BE UNMANLY YET ARE FOLLOWD 
AS FAR AS I SEE ALL THE GOOD OUR ENGLISH

OUT OF A FOREIGN WISDOM RENOUNCING CLEAN
THE FAITH THEY HAVE IN TENNIS AND TALL STOCKINGS
SHORT BLISTERD BREECHES AND THOSE TYPES OF TRAVEL

THE LAG END OF THEIR LEWDNESS AND BE LAUGHD AT

TO LEAD EM ONCE AGAIN AND THEN LETS DREAM
WHOS BEST IN FAVOUR  LET THE MUSIC KNOCK IT 
WHITHER AWAY SO FAST
O GOD SAVE YE 
EVEN TO THE HALL TO HEAR WHAT SHALL BECOME
OF THE GREAT DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 
ILL SAVE YOU
THAT LABOUR SIR  ALLS NOW DONE BUT THE CEREMONY
OF BRINGING BACK THE PRISONER 
WERE YOU THERE
YES INDEED WAS I 
PRAY SPEAK WHAT HAS HAPPEND 
YOU MAY GUESS QUICKLY WHAT 
IS HE FOUND GUILTY
YES TRULY IS HE AND CONDEMND UPONT 
I AM SORRY FORT 
SO ARE A NUMBER MORE 
BUT PRAY HOW PASSD IT
ILL TELL YOU IN A LITTLE  THE GREAT DUKE
CAME TO THE BAR WHERE TO HIS ACCUSATIONS
HE PLEADED STILL NOT GUILTY AND ALLEGED
MANY SHARP REASONS TO DEFEAT THE LAW 
THE KINGS ATTORNEY ON THE CONTRARY
URGED ON THE EXAMINATIONS PROOFS CONFESSIONS
OF DIVERS WITNESSES WHICH THE DUKE DESIRED
TO HAVE BROUGHT VIVA VOCE TO HIS FACE
AT WHICH APPEARD AGAINST HIM HIS SURVEYOR
SIR GILBERT PECK HIS CHANCELLOR AND JOHN CAR
CONFESSOR TO HIM WITH THAT DEVILMONK
HOPKINS THAT MADE THIS MISCHIEF 
THAT WAS HE
THAT FED HIM WITH HIS PROPHECIES
THE SAME 
ALL THESE ACCUSED HIM STRONGLY WHICH HE FAIN
WOULD HAVE FLUNG FROM HIM BUT INDEED HE COULD NOT
AND SO HIS PEERS UPON THIS EVIDENCE
HAVE FOUND HIM GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON  MUCH
HE SPOKE AND LEARNEDLY FOR LIFE BUT ALL
WAS EITHER PITIED IN HIM OR FORGOTTEN 
AFTER ALL THIS HOW DID HE BEAR HIMSELF
WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT AGAIN TO THE BAR TO HEAR
HIS KNELL RUNG OUT HIS JUDGMENT HE WAS STIRRD
WITH SUCH AN AGONY HE SWEAT EXTREMELY
AND SOMETHING SPOKE IN CHOLER ILL AND HASTY
BUT HE FELL TO HIMSELF AGAIN AND SWEETLY
IN ALL THE REST SHOWD A MOST NOBLE PATIENCE 
I DO NOT THINK HE FEARS DEATH 
SURE HE DOES NOT
HE NEVER WAS SO WOMANISH THE CAUSE
HE MAY A LITTLE GRIEVE AT 
CERTAINLY
THE CARDINAL IS THE END OF THIS 
TIS LIKELY
BY ALL CONJECTURES FIRST KILDARES ATTAINDER
THEN DEPUTY OF IRELAND WHO REMOVED
EARL SURREY WAS SENT THITHER AND IN HASTE TOO
LEST HE SHOULD HELP HIS FATHER 
THAT TRICK OF STATE
WAS A DEEP ENVIOUS ONE 
AT HIS RETURN
NO DOUBT HE WILL REQUITE IT  THIS IS NOTED
AND GENERALLY WHOEVER THE KING FAVOURS
THE CARDINAL INSTANTLY WILL FIND EMPLOYMENT
AND FAR ENOUGH FROM COURT TOO 
ALL THE COMMONS
HATE HIM PERNICIOUSLY AND O MY CONSCIENCE
WISH HIM TEN FATHOM DEEP THIS DUKE AS MUCH
THEY LOVE AND DOTE ON CALL HIM BOUNTEOUS BUCKINGHAM
THE MIRROR OF ALL COURTESY 
STAY THERE SIR
AND SEE THE NOBLE RUIND MAN YOU SPEAK OF 
LETS STAND CLOSE AND BEHOLD HIM 
ALL GOOD PEOPLE
YOU THAT THUS FAR HAVE COME TO PITY ME
HEAR WHAT I SAY AND THEN GO HOME AND LOSE ME 
I HAVE THIS DAY RECEIVED A TRAITORS JUDGMENT
AND BY THAT NAME MUST DIE YET HEAVEN BEAR WITNESS
AND IF I HAVE A CONSCIENCE LET IT SINK ME
EVEN AS THE AXE FALLS IF I BE NOT FAITHFUL 
THE LAW I BEAR NO MALICE FOR MY DEATH
T HAS DONE UPON THE PREMISES BUT JUSTICE
BUT THOSE THAT SOUGHT IT I COULD WISH MORE CHRISTIANS
BE WHAT THEY WILL I HEARTILY FORGIVE EM
YET LET EM LOOK THEY GLORY NOT IN MISCHIEF
NOR BUILD THEIR EVILS ON THE GRAVES OF GREAT MEN
FOR THEN MY GUILTLESS BLOOD MUST CRY AGAINST EM 
FOR FURTHER LIFE IN THIS WORLD I NEER HOPE
NOR WILL I SUE ALTHOUGH THE KING HAVE MERCIES
MORE THAN I DARE MAKE FAULTS  YOU FEW THAT LOVED ME
AND DARE BE BOLD TO WEEP FOR BUCKINGHAM
HIS NOBLE FRIENDS AND FELLOWS WHOM TO LEAVE
IS ONLY BITTER TO HIM ONLY DYING
GO WITH ME LIKE GOOD ANGELS TO MY END
AND AS THE LONG DIVORCE OF STEEL FALLS ON ME
MAKE OF YOUR PRAYERS ONE SWEET SACRIFICE
AND LIFT MY SOUL TO HEAVEN  LEAD ON O GODS NAME 
I DO BESEECH YOUR GRACE FOR CHARITY
IF EVER ANY MALICE IN YOUR HEART
WERE HID AGAINST ME NOW TO FORGIVE ME FRANKLY 
SIR THOMAS LOVELL I AS FREE FORGIVE YOU
AS I WOULD BE FORGIVEN I FORGIVE ALL
THERE CANNOT BE THOSE NUMBERLESS OFFENCES
GAINST ME THAT I CANNOT TAKE PEACE WITH
NO BLACK ENVY
SHALL MARK MY GRAVE  COMMEND ME TO HIS GRACE
AND IF HE SPEAK OF BUCKINGHAM PRAY TELL HIM
YOU MET HIM HALF IN HEAVEN MY VOWS AND PRAYERS
YET ARE THE KINGS AND TILL MY SOUL FORSAKE
SHALL CRY FOR BLESSINGS ON HIM MAY HE LIVE
LONGER THAN I HAVE TIME TO TELL HIS YEARS 
EVER BELOVED AND LOVING MAY HIS RULE BE 
AND WHEN OLD TIME SHALL LEAD HIM TO HIS END
GOODNESS AND HE FILL UP ONE MONUMENT 
TO THE WATER SIDE I MUST CONDUCT YOUR GRACE
THEN GIVE MY CHARGE UP TO SIR NICHOLAS VAUX
WHO UNDERTAKES YOU TO YOUR END 
PREPARE THERE

AND FIT IT WITH SUCH FURNITURE AS SUITS
THE GREATNESS OF HIS PERSON 
NAY SIR NICHOLAS

THE GOODNESS OF YOUR INTERCEPTED PACKETS
YOU WRIT TO THE POPE AGAINST THE KING YOUR GOODNESS
SINCE YOU PROVOKE ME SHALL BE MOST NOTORIOUS 
MY LORD OF NORFOLK AS YOU ARE TRULY NOBLE
AS YOU RESPECT THE COMMON GOOD THE STATE
OF OUR DESPISED NOBILITY OUR ISSUES
WHO IF HE LIVE WILL SCARCE BE GENTLEMEN
PRODUCE THE GRAND SUM OF HIS SINS THE ARTICLES
COLLECTED FROM HIS LIFE  ILL STARTLE YOU
WORSE THAN THE SCARING BELL WHEN THE BROWN WENCH
LAY KISSING IN YOUR ARMS LORD CARDINAL 
HOW MUCH METHINKS I COULD DESPISE THIS MAN
BUT THAT I AM BOUND IN CHARITY AGAINST IT 
THOSE ARTICLES MY LORD ARE IN THE KINGS HAND
BUT THUS MUCH THEY ARE FOUL ONES 
SO MUCH FAIRER
AND SPOTLESS SHALL MINE INNOCENCE ARISE
WHEN THE KING KNOWS MY TRUTH 
THIS CANNOT SAVE YOU
I THANK MY MEMORY I YET REMEMBER
SOME OF THESE ARTICLES AND OUT THEY SHALL 
NOW IF YOU CAN BLUSH AND CRY GUILTY CARDINAL
YOULL SHOW A LITTLE HONESTY 
SPEAK ON SIR
I DARE YOUR WORST OBJECTIONS IF I BLUSH
IT IS TO SEE A NOBLEMAN WANT MANNERS 
I HAD RATHER WANT THOSE THAN MY HEAD  HAVE AT YOU 
FIRST THAT WITHOUT THE KINGS ASSENT OR KNOWLEDGE
YOU WROUGHT TO BE A LEGATE BY WHICH POWER
YOU MAIMD THE JURISDICTION OF ALL BISHOPS 
THEN THAT IN ALL YOU WRIT TO ROME OR ELSE
TO FOREIGN PRINCES EGO ET REX MEUS
WAS STILL INSCRIBED IN WHICH YOU BROUGHT THE KING
TO BE YOUR SERVANT 
THEN THAT WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
EITHER OF KING OR COUNCIL WHEN YOU WENT
AMBASSADOR TO THE EMPEROR YOU MADE BOLD
TO CARRY INTO FLANDERS THE GREAT SEAL 
ITEM YOU SENT A LARGE COMMISSION
TO GREGORY DE CASSADO TO CONCLUDE
WITHOUT THE KINGS WILL OR THE STATES ALLOWANCE
A LEAGUE BETWEEN HIS HIGHNESS AND FERRARA 
THAT OUT OF MERE AMBITION YOU HAVE CAUSED
YOUR HOLY HAT TO BE STAMPD ON THE KINGS COIN 
THEN THAT YOU HAVE SENT INNUMERABLE SUBSTANCE 
BY WHAT MEANS GOT I LEAVE TO YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE 
TO FURNISH ROME AND TO PREPARE THE WAYS
YOU HAVE FOR DIGNITIES TO THE MERE UNDOING
OF ALL THE KINGDOM  MANY MORE THERE ARE
WHICH SINCE THEY ARE OF YOU AND ODIOUS
I WILL NOT TAINT MY MOUTH WITH 
O MY LORD
PRESS NOT A FALLING MAN TOO FAR  TIS VIRTUE
HIS FAULTS LIE OPEN TO THE LAWS LET THEM
NOT YOU CORRECT HIM  MY HEART WEEPS TO SEE HIM
SO LITTLE OF HIS GREAT SELF 
I FORGIVE HIM 
LORD CARDINAL THE KINGS FURTHER PLEASURE IS
BECAUSE ALL THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE OF LATE
BY YOUR POWER LEGATINE WITHIN THIS KINGDOM
FALL INTO THE COMPASS OF A PRAEMUNIRE
THAT THEREFORE SUCH A WRIT BE SUED AGAINST YOU
TO FORFEIT ALL YOUR GOODS LANDS TENEMENTS
CHATTELS AND WHATSOEVER AND TO BE
OUT OF THE KINGS PROTECTION  THIS IS MY CHARGE 
AND SO WELL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR MEDITATIONS
HOW TO LIVE BETTER  FOR YOUR STUBBORN ANSWER
ABOUT THE GIVING BACK THE GREAT SEAL TO US
THE KING SHALL KNOW IT AND NO DOUBT SHALL THANK YOU 
SO FARE YOU WELL MY LITTLE GOOD LORD CARDINAL 
SO FAREWELL TO THE LITTLE GOOD YOU BEAR ME 
FAREWELL  A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS 
THIS IS THE STATE OF MAN TODAY HE PUTS FORTH
THE TENDER LEAVES OF HOPES TOMORROW BLOSSOMS
AND BEARS HIS BLUSHING HONOURS THICK UPON HIM
THE THIRD DAY COMES A FROST A KILLING FROST
AND WHEN HE THINKS GOOD EASY MAN FULL SURELY
HIS GREATNESS IS ARIPENING NIPS HIS ROOT
AND THEN HE FALLS AS I DO  I HAVE VENTURED
LIKE LITTLE WANTON BOYS THAT SWIM ON BLADDERS
THIS MANY SUMMERS IN A SEA OF GLORY
BUT FAR BEYOND MY DEPTH MY HIGHBLOWN PRIDE
AT LENGTH BROKE UNDER ME AND NOW HAS LEFT ME
WEARY AND OLD WITH SERVICE TO THE MERCY
OF A RUDE STREAM THAT MUST FOR EVER HIDE ME 
VAIN POMP AND GLORY OF THIS WORLD I HATE YE
I FEEL MY HEART NEW OPEND  O HOW WRETCHED
IS THAT POOR MAN THAT HANGS ON PRINCES FAVOURS 
THERE IS BETWIXT THAT SMILE WE WOULD ASPIRE TO
THAT SWEET ASPECT OF PRINCES AND THEIR RUIN
MORE PANGS AND FEARS THAN WARS OR WOMEN HAVE
AND WHEN HE FALLS HE FALLS LIKE LUCIFER
NEVER TO HOPE AGAIN 
WHY HOW NOW CROMWELL 
I HAVE NO POWER TO SPEAK SIR 
WHAT AMAZED
AT MY MISFORTUNES CAN THY SPIRIT WONDER
A GREAT MAN SHOULD DECLINE NAY AN YOU WEEP
I AM FALLN INDEED 
HOW DOES YOUR GRACE
WHY WELL
NEVER SO TRULY HAPPY MY GOOD CROMWELL 
I KNOW MYSELF NOW AND I FEEL WITHIN ME
A PEACE ABOVE ALL EARTHLY DIGNITIES
A STILL AND QUIET CONSCIENCE  THE KING HAS CURED ME
I HUMBLY THANK HIS GRACE AND FROM THESE SHOULDERS
THESE RUIND PILLARS OUT OF PITY TAKEN
A LOAD WOULD SINK A NAVY TOO MUCH HONOUR
O TIS A BURTHEN CROMWELL TIS A BURTHEN
TOO HEAVY FOR A MAN THAT HOPES FOR HEAVEN

BUT I BESEECH YOU WHATS BECOME OF KATHARINE
THE PRINCESS DOWAGER HOW GOES HER BUSINESS
THAT I CAN TELL YOU TOO  THE ARCHBISHOP
OF CANTERBURY ACCOMPANIED WITH OTHER
LEARNED AND REVEREND FATHERS OF HIS ORDER
HELD A LATE COURT AT DUNSTABLE SIX MILES OFF
FROM AMPTHILL WHERE THE PRINCESS LAY TO WHICH
SHE WAS OFTEN CITED BY THEM BUT APPEARD NOT
AND TO BE SHORT FOR NOT APPEARANCE AND
THE KINGS LATE SCRUPLE BY THE MAIN ASSENT
OF ALL THESE LEARNED MEN SHE WAS DIVORCED
AND THE LATE MARRIAGE MADE OF NONE EFFECT
SINCE WHICH SHE WAS REMOVED TO KIMBOLTON
WHERE SHE REMAINS NOW SICK 
ALAS GOOD LADY 
THE TRUMPETS SOUND STAND CLOSE THE QUEEN IS COMING

OF THE CINQUEPORTS 
THOSE MEN ARE HAPPY AND SO ARE ALL ARE NEAR HER 
I TAKE IT SHE THAT CARRIES UP THE TRAIN
IS THAT OLD NOBLE LADY DUCHESS OF NORFOLK 
IT IS AND ALL THE REST ARE COUNTESSES 
THEIR CORONETS SAY SO  THESE ARE STARS INDEED
AND SOMETIMES FALLING ONES 
NO MORE OF THAT 
GOD SAVE YOU SIR  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN BROILING
AMONG THE CROWD I THE ABBEY WHERE A FINGER
COULD NOT BE WEDGED IN MORE I AM STIFLED
WITH THE MERE RANKNESS OF THEIR JOY 
YOU SAW
THE CEREMONY
THAT I DID 
HOW WAS IT
WELL WORTH THE SEEING 
GOOD SIR SPEAK IT TO US 
AS WELL AS I AM ABLE  THE RICH STREAM
OF LORDS AND LADIES HAVING BROUGHT THE QUEEN
TO A PREPARED PLACE IN THE CHOIR FELL OFF
A DISTANCE FROM HER WHILE HER GRACE SAT DOWN
TO REST AWHILE SOME HALF AN HOUR OR SO
IN A RICH CHAIR OF STATE OPPOSING FREELY
THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON TO THE PEOPLE 
BELIEVE ME SIR SHE IS THE GOODLIEST WOMAN
THAT EVER LAY BY MAN WHICH WHEN THE PEOPLE
HAD THE FULL VIEW OF SUCH A NOISE AROSE
AS THE SHROUDS MAKE AT SEA IN A STIFF TEMPEST
AS LOUD AND TO AS MANY TUNES HATS CLOAKS 
DOUBLETS I THINK FLEW UP AND HAD THEIR FACES
BEEN LOOSE THIS DAY THEY HAD BEEN LOST  SUCH JOY
I NEVER SAW BEFORE  GREATBELLIED WOMEN
THAT HAD NOT HALF A WEEK TO GO LIKE RAMS
IN THE OLD TIME OF WAR WOULD SHAKE THE PRESS
AND MAKE EM REEL BEFORE EM  NO MAN LIVING
COULD SAY THIS IS MY WIFE THERE ALL WERE WOVEN
SO STRANGELY IN ONE PIECE 
BUT WHAT FOLLOWD
AT LENGTH HER GRACE ROSE AND WITH MODEST PACES
CAME TO THE ALTAR WHERE SHE KNEELD AND SAINTLIKE
CAST HER FAIR EYES TO HEAVEN AND PRAYD DEVOUTLY 
THEN ROSE AGAIN AND BOWD HER TO THE PEOPLE
WHEN BY THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
SHE HAD ALL THE ROYAL MAKINGS OF A QUEEN
AS HOLY OIL EDWARD CONFESSORS CROWN
THE ROD AND BIRD OF PEACE AND ALL SUCH EMBLEMS
LAID NOBLY ON HER WHICH PERFORMD THE CHOIR
WITH ALL THE CHOICEST MUSIC OF THE KINGDOM
TOGETHER SUNG TE DEUM  SO SHE PARTED
AND WITH THE SAME FULL STATE PACED BACK AGAIN
TO YORKPLACE WHERE THE FEAST IS HELD 
SIR
YOU MUST NO MORE CALL IT YORKPLACE THATS PAST
FOR SINCE THE CARDINAL FELL THAT TITLES LOST
TIS NOW THE KINGS AND CALLD WHITEHALL 
I KNOW IT
BUT TIS SO LATELY ALTERD THAT THE OLD NAME
IS FRESH ABOUT ME 
WHAT TWO REVEREND BISHOPS
WERE THOSE THAT WENT ON EACH SIDE OF THE QUEEN
STOKESLY AND GARDINER THE ONE OF WINCHESTER
NEWLY PREFERRD FROM THE KINGS SECRETARY
THE OTHER LONDON 
HE OF WINCHESTER
IS HELD NO GREAT GOOD LOVER OF THE ARCHBISHOPS
THE VIRTUOUS CRANMER 
ALL THE LAND KNOWS THAT
HOWEVER YET THERE IS NO GREAT BREACH WHEN IT COMES
CRANMER WILL FIND A FRIEND WILL NOT SHRINK FROM HIM 
WHO MAY THAT BE I PRAY YOU
THOMAS CROMWELL
A MAN IN MUCH ESTEEM WITH THE KING AND TRULY
A WORTHY FRIEND  THE KING HAS MADE HIM MASTER
O THE JEWEL HOUSE
AND ONE ALREADY OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL 
HE WILL DESERVE MORE 
YES WITHOUT ALL DOUBT 
COME GENTLEMEN YE SHALL GO MY WAY WHICH
IS TO THE COURT AND THERE YE SHALL BE MY GUESTS
SOMETHING I CAN COMMAND  AS I WALK THITHER
ILL TELL YE MORE 
YOU MAY COMMAND US SIR 
HOW DOES YOUR GRACE
O GRIFFITH SICK TO DEATH 
MY LEGS LIKE LOADEN BRANCHES BOW TO THE EARTH
WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR BURTHEN  REACH A CHAIR
SO NOW METHINKS I FEEL A LITTLE EASE 
DIDST THOU NOT TELL ME GRIFFITH AS THOU LEDST ME
THAT THE GREAT CHILD OF HONOUR CARDINAL WOLSEY WAS DEAD
YES MADAM BUT I THINK YOUR GRACE
OUT OF THE PAIN YOU SUFFERD GAVE NO EAR TOT 
PRITHEE GOOD GRIFFITH TELL ME HOW HE DIED
IF WELL HE STEPPD BEFORE ME HAPPILY
FOR MY EXAMPLE 
WELL THE VOICE GOES MADAM
FOR AFTER THE STOUT EARL NORTHUMBERLAND
ARRESTED HIM AT YORK AND BROUGHT HIM FORWARD
AS A MAN SORELY TAINTED TO HIS ANSWER
HE FELL SICK SUDDENLY AND GREW SO ILL
HE COULD NOT SIT HIS MULE 
ALAS POOR MAN 
AT LAST WITH EASY ROADS HE CAME TO LEICESTER
LODGED IN THE ABBEY WHERE THE REVEREND ABBOT
WITH ALL HIS COVENT HONOURABLY RECEIVED HIM
TO WHOM HE GAVE THESE WORDS O FATHER ABBOT
AN OLD MAN BROKEN WITH THE STORMS OF STATE
IS COME TO LAY HIS WEARY BONES AMONG YE
GIVE HIM A LITTLE EARTH FOR CHARITY 
SO WENT TO BED WHERE EAGERLY HIS SICKNESS
PURSUED HIM STILL AND THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS
ABOUT THE HOUR OF EIGHT WHICH HE HIMSELF
FORETOLD SHOULD BE HIS LAST FULL OF REPENTANCE
CONTINUAL MEDITATIONS TEARS AND SORROWS
HE GAVE HIS HONOURS TO THE WORLD AGAIN
HIS BLESSED PART TO HEAVEN AND SLEPT IN PEACE 
SO MAY HE REST HIS FAULTS LIE GENTLY ON HIM 
YET THUS FAR GRIFFITH GIVE ME LEAVE TO SPEAK HIM
AND YET WITH CHARITY  HE WAS A MAN
OF AN UNBOUNDED STOMACH EVER RANKING
HIMSELF WITH PRINCES ONE THAT BY SUGGESTION
TIED ALL THE KINGDOM SIMONY WAS FAIRPLAY
HIS OWN OPINION WAS HIS LAW I THE PRESENCE
HE WOULD SAY UNTRUTHS AND BE EVER DOUBLE
BOTH IN HIS WORDS AND MEANING HE WAS NEVER
BUT WHERE HE MEANT TO RUIN PITIFUL
HIS PROMISES WERE AS HE THEN WAS MIGHTY
BUT HIS PERFORMANCE AS HE IS NOW NOTHING
OF HIS OWN BODY HE WAS ILL AND GAVE
THE CLERGY IN EXAMPLE 
NOBLE MADAM
MENS EVIL MANNERS LIVE IN BRASS THEIR VIRTUES
WE WRITE IN WATER  MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS
TO HEAR ME SPEAK HIS GOOD NOW
YES GOOD GRIFFITH
I WERE MALICIOUS ELSE 
THIS CARDINAL
THOUGH FROM AN HUMBLE STOCK UNDOUBTEDLY
WAS FASHIOND TO MUCH HONOUR FROM HIS CRADLE 
HE WAS A SCHOLAR AND A RIPE AND GOOD ONE
EXCEEDING WISE FAIRSPOKEN AND PERSUADING
LOFTY AND SOUR TO THEM THAT LOVED HIM NOT
BUT TO THOSE MEN THAT SOUGHT HIM SWEET AS SUMMER 
AND THOUGH HE WERE UNSATISFIED IN GETTING
WHICH WAS A SIN YET IN BESTOWING MADAM
HE WAS MOST PRINCELY EVER WITNESS FOR HIM
THOSE TWINS OF LEARNING THAT HE RAISED IN YOU
IPSWICH AND OXFORD  ONE OF WHICH FELL WITH HIM
UNWILLING TO OUTLIVE THE GOOD THAT DID IT
THE OTHER THOUGH UNFINISHD YET SO FAMOUS
SO EXCELLENT IN ART AND STILL SO RISING
THAT CHRISTENDOM SHALL EVER SPEAK HIS VIRTUE 
HIS OVERTHROW HEAPD HAPPINESS UPON HIM
FOR THEN AND NOT TILL THEN HE FELT HIMSELF
AND FOUND THE BLESSEDNESS OF BEING LITTLE
AND TO ADD GREATER HONOURS TO HIS AGE
THAN MAN COULD GIVE HIM HE DIED FEARING GOD 
AFTER MY DEATH I WISH NO OTHER HERALD
NO OTHER SPEAKER OF MY LIVING ACTIONS
TO KEEP MINE HONOUR FROM CORRUPTION
BUT SUCH AN HONEST CHRONICLER AS GRIFFITH 
WHOM I MOST HATED LIVING THOU HAST MADE ME
WITH THY RELIGIOUS TRUTH AND MODESTY
NOW IN HIS ASHES HONOUR PEACE BE WITH HIM 
PATIENCE BE NEAR ME STILL AND SET ME LOWER

WAS EVER TO DO WELL NOR IS THERE LIVING
I SPEAK IT WITH A SINGLE HEART MY LORDS
A MAN THAT MORE DETESTS MORE STIRS AGAINST
BOTH IN HIS PRIVATE CONSCIENCE AND HIS PLACE

WITH LESS ALLEGIANCE IN IT  MEN THAT MAKE
ENVY AND CROOKED MALICE NOURISHMENT
