WHAT WE HAVE TWO NIGHTS SEEN 
WELL SIT WE DOWN

LAST NIGHT OF ALL
WHEN YOND SAME STAR THATS WESTWARD FROM THE POLE
HAD MADE HIS COURSE TO ILLUME THAT PART OF HEAVEN
WHERE NOW IT BURNS MARCELLUS AND MYSELF

PEACE BREAK THEE OFF LOOK WHERE IT COMES AGAIN 
IN THE SAME FIGURE LIKE THE KING THATS DEAD

OF MINE OWN EYES 
IS IT NOT LIKE THE KING
AS THOU ART TO THYSELF
SUCH WAS THE VERY ARMOUR HE HAD ON
WHEN HE THE AMBITIOUS NORWAY COMBATED
SO FROWND HE ONCE WHEN IN AN ANGRY PARLE
HE SMOTE THE SLEDDED POLACKS ON THE ICE 
TIS STRANGE 
THUS TWICE BEFORE AND JUMP AT THIS DEAD HOUR
WITH MARTIAL STALK HATH HE GONE BY OUR WATCH 
IN WHAT PARTICULAR THOUGHT TO WORK I KNOW NOT
BUT IN THE GROSS AND SCOPE OF MY OPINION
THIS BODES SOME STRANGE ERUPTION TO OUR STATE 
GOOD NOW SIT DOWN AND TELL ME HE THAT KNOWS
WHY THIS SAME STRICT AND MOST OBSERVANT WATCH
SO NIGHTLY TOILS THE SUBJECT OF THE LAND
AND WHY SUCH DAILY CAST OF BRAZEN CANNON
AND FOREIGN MART FOR IMPLEMENTS OF WAR
WHY SUCH IMPRESS OF SHIPWRIGHTS WHOSE SORE TASK
DOES NOT DIVIDE THE SUNDAY FROM THE WEEK
WHAT MIGHT BE TOWARD THAT THIS SWEATY HASTE
DOTH MAKE THE NIGHT JOINTLABOURER WITH THE DAY
WHO IST THAT CAN INFORM ME
THAT CAN I
AT LEAST THE WHISPER GOES SO  OUR LAST KING
WHOSE IMAGE EVEN BUT NOW APPEARD TO US
WAS AS YOU KNOW BY FORTINBRAS OF NORWAY
THERETO PRICKD ON BY A MOST EMULATE PRIDE
DARED TO THE COMBAT IN WHICH OUR VALIANT HAMLET 
FOR SO THIS SIDE OF OUR KNOWN WORLD ESTEEMD HIM 
DID SLAY THIS FORTINBRAS WHO BY A SEALD COMPACT
WELL RATIFIED BY LAW AND HERALDRY
DID FORFEIT WITH HIS LIFE ALL THOSE HIS LANDS
WHICH HE STOOD SEIZED OF TO THE CONQUEROR
AGAINST THE WHICH A MOIETY COMPETENT
WAS GAGED BY OUR KING WHICH HAD RETURND
TO THE INHERITANCE OF FORTINBRAS
HAD HE BEEN VANQUISHER AS BY THE SAME COVENANT
AND CARRIAGE OF THE ARTICLE DESIGND
HIS FELL TO HAMLET  NOW SIR YOUNG FORTINBRAS
OF UNIMPROVED METTLE HOT AND FULL
HATH IN THE SKIRTS OF NORWAY HERE AND THERE
SHARKD UP A LIST OF LAWLESS RESOLUTES
FOR FOOD AND DIET TO SOME ENTERPRISE
THAT HATH A STOMACH INT WHICH IS NO OTHER 
AS IT DOTH WELL APPEAR UNTO OUR STATE 
BUT TO RECOVER OF US BY STRONG HAND
AND TERMS COMPULSATORY THOSE FORESAID LANDS
SO BY HIS FATHER LOST AND THIS I TAKE IT
IS THE MAIN MOTIVE OF OUR PREPARATIONS
THE SOURCE OF THIS OUR WATCH AND THE CHIEF HEAD
OF THIS POSTHASTE AND ROMAGE IN THE LAND 
I THINK IT BE NO OTHER BUT EEN SO
WELL MAY IT SORT THAT THIS PORTENTOUS FIGURE
COMES ARMED THROUGH OUR WATCH SO LIKE THE KING
THAT WAS AND IS THE QUESTION OF THESE WARS 
A MOTE IT IS TO TROUBLE THE MINDS EYE 
IN THE MOST HIGH AND PALMY STATE OF ROME
A LITTLE ERE THE MIGHTIEST JULIUS FELL
THE GRAVES STOOD TENANTLESS AND THE SHEETED DEAD
DID SQUEAK AND GIBBER IN THE ROMAN STREETS
AS STARS WITH TRAINS OF FIRE AND DEWS OF BLOOD
DISASTERS IN THE SUN AND THE MOIST STAR
UPON WHOSE INFLUENCE NEPTUNES EMPIRE STANDS
WAS SICK ALMOST TO DOOMSDAY WITH ECLIPSE
AND EVEN THE LIKE PRECURSE OF FIERCE EVENTS
AS HARBINGERS PRECEDING STILL THE FATES
AND PROLOGUE TO THE OMEN COMING ON
HAVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TOGETHER DEMONSTRATED
UNTO OUR CLIMATURES AND COUNTRYMEN  
BUT SOFT BEHOLD  LO WHERE IT COMES AGAIN 
ILL CROSS IT THOUGH IT BLAST ME  STAY ILLUSION 
IF THOU HAST ANY SOUND OR USE OF VOICE
SPEAK TO ME
IF THERE BE ANY GOOD THING TO BE DONE
THAT MAY TO THEE DO EASE AND GRACE TO ME
SPEAK TO ME
IF THOU ART PRIVY TO THY COUNTRYS FATE
WHICH HAPPILY FOREKNOWING MAY AVOID O SPEAK 
OR IF THOU HAST UPHOARDED IN THY LIFE
EXTORTED TREASURE IN THE WOMB OF EARTH
FOR WHICH THEY SAY YOU SPIRITS OFT WALK IN DEATH
SPEAK OF IT STAY AND SPEAK  STOP IT MARCELLUS 
SHALL I STRIKE AT IT WITH MY PARTISAN
DO IF IT WILL NOT STAND 
TIS HERE 
TIS HERE 
TIS GONE 
WE DO IT WRONG BEING SO MAJESTICAL
TO OFFER IT THE SHOW OF VIOLENCE
FOR IT IS AS THE AIR INVULNERABLE
AND OUR VAIN BLOWS MALICIOUS MOCKERY 
IT WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN THE COCK CREW 
AND THEN IT STARTED LIKE A GUILTY THING
UPON A FEARFUL SUMMONS  I HAVE HEARD
THE COCK THAT IS THE TRUMPET TO THE MORN
DOTH WITH HIS LOFTY AND SHRILLSOUNDING THROAT
AWAKE THE GOD OF DAY AND AT HIS WARNING
WHETHER IN SEA OR FIRE IN EARTH OR AIR
THE EXTRAVAGANT AND ERRING SPIRIT HIES
TO HIS CONFINE AND OF THE TRUTH HEREIN
THIS PRESENT OBJECT MADE PROBATION 
IT FADED ON THE CROWING OF THE COCK 
SOME SAY THAT EVER GAINST THAT SEASON COMES
WHEREIN OUR SAVIOURS BIRTH IS CELEBRATED
THE BIRD OF DAWNING SINGETH ALL NIGHT LONG
AND THEN THEY SAY NO SPIRIT DARES STIR ABROAD
THE NIGHTS ARE WHOLESOME THEN NO PLANETS STRIKE
NO FAIRY TAKES NOR WITCH HATH POWER TO CHARM
SO HALLOWD AND SO GRACIOUS IS THE TIME 
SO HAVE I HEARD AND DO IN PART BELIEVE IT 
BUT LOOK THE MORN IN RUSSET MANTLE CLAD
WALKS OER THE DEW OF YON HIGH EASTWARD HILL
BREAK WE OUR WATCH UP AND BY MY ADVICE
LET US IMPART WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TONIGHT
UNTO YOUNG HAMLET FOR UPON MY LIFE
THIS SPIRIT DUMB TO US WILL SPEAK TO HIM 
DO YOU CONSENT WE SHALL ACQUAINT HIM WITH IT
AS NEEDFUL IN OUR LOVES FITTING OUR DUTY
LETS DOT I PRAY AND I THIS MORNING KNOW
WHERE WE SHALL FIND HIM MOST CONVENIENTLY 
THOUGH YET OF HAMLET OUR DEAR BROTHERS DEATH
THE MEMORY BE GREEN AND THAT IT US BEFITTED
TO BEAR OUR HEARTS IN GRIEF AND OUR WHOLE KINGDOM
TO BE CONTRACTED IN ONE BROW OF WOE
YET SO FAR HATH DISCRETION FOUGHT WITH NATURE
THAT WE WITH WISEST SORROW THINK ON HIM
TOGETHER WITH REMEMBRANCE OF OURSELVES 
THEREFORE OUR SOMETIME SISTER NOW OUR QUEEN
THE IMPERIAL JOINTRESS TO THIS WARLIKE STATE
HAVE WE AS TWERE WITH A DEFEATED JOY 
WITH AN AUSPICIOUS AND A DROPPING EYE
WITH MIRTH IN FUNERAL AND WITH DIRGE IN MARRIAGE
IN EQUAL SCALE WEIGHING DELIGHT AND DOLE 
TAKEN TO WIFE NOR HAVE WE HEREIN BARRD
YOUR BETTER WISDOMS WHICH HAVE FREELY GONE
WITH THIS AFFAIR ALONG  FOR ALL OUR THANKS 
NOW FOLLOWS THAT YOU KNOW YOUNG FORTINBRAS
HOLDING A WEAK SUPPOSAL OF OUR WORTH
OR THINKING BY OUR LATE DEAR BROTHERS DEATH
OUR STATE TO BE DISJOINT AND OUT OF FRAME
COLLEAGUED WITH THE DREAM OF HIS ADVANTAGE
HE HATH NOT FAILD TO PESTER US WITH MESSAGE
IMPORTING THE SURRENDER OF THOSE LANDS
LOST BY HIS FATHER WITH ALL BONDS OF LAW
TO OUR MOST VALIANT BROTHER  SO MUCH FOR HIM 
NOW FOR OURSELF AND FOR THIS TIME OF MEETING
THUS MUCH THE BUSINESS IS WE HAVE HERE WRIT
TO NORWAY UNCLE OF YOUNG FORTINBRAS 
WHO IMPOTENT AND BEDRID SCARCELY HEARS
OF THIS HIS NEPHEWS PURPOSE TO SUPPRESS
HIS FURTHER GAIT HEREIN IN THAT THE LEVIES
THE LISTS AND FULL PROPORTIONS ARE ALL MADE
OUT OF HIS SUBJECT AND WE HERE DISPATCH
YOU GOOD CORNELIUS AND YOU VOLTIMAND
FOR BEARERS OF THIS GREETING TO OLD NORWAY
GIVING TO YOU NO FURTHER PERSONAL POWER
TO BUSINESS WITH THE KING MORE THAN THE SCOPE
OF THESE DELATED ARTICLES ALLOW

IN THAT AND ALL THINGS WILL WE SHOW OUR DUTY 
WE DOUBT IT NOTHING HEARTILY FAREWELL 
AND NOW LAERTES WHATS THE NEWS WITH YOU

YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF REASON TO THE DANE
AND LOOSE YOUR VOICE WHAT WOULDST THOU BEG LAERTES
THAT SHALL NOT BE MY OFFER NOT THY ASKING
THE HEAD IS NOT MORE NATIVE TO THE HEART
THE HAND MORE INSTRUMENTAL TO THE MOUTH
THAN IS THE THRONE OF DENMARK TO THY FATHER 
WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE LAERTES
MY DREAD LORD
YOUR LEAVE AND FAVOUR TO RETURN TO FRANCE
FROM WHENCE THOUGH WILLINGLY I CAME TO DENMARK
TO SHOW MY DUTY IN YOUR CORONATION
YET NOW I MUST CONFESS THAT DUTY DONE
MY THOUGHTS AND WISHES BEND AGAIN TOWARD FRANCE
AND BOW THEM TO YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE AND PARDON 
HAVE YOU YOUR FATHERS LEAVE WHAT SAYS POLONIUS
HE HATH MY LORD WRUNG FROM ME MY SLOW LEAVE
BY LABOURSOME PETITION AND AT LAST
UPON HIS WILL I SEALD MY HARD CONSENT
I DO BESEECH YOU GIVE HIM LEAVE TO GO 
TAKE THY FAIR HOUR LAERTES TIME BE THINE
AND THY BEST GRACES SPEND IT AT THY WILL 
BUT NOW MY COUSIN HAMLET AND MY SON

TIS SWEET AND COMMENDABLE IN YOUR NATURE HAMLET
TO GIVE THESE MOURNING DUTIES TO YOUR FATHER
BUT YOU MUST KNOW YOUR FATHER LOST A FATHER
THAT FATHER LOST LOST HIS AND THE SURVIVOR BOUND
IN FILIAL OBLIGATION FOR SOME TERM
TO DO OBSEQUIOUS SORROW BUT TO PERSEVER
IN OBSTINATE CONDOLEMENT IS A COURSE
OF IMPIOUS STUBBORNNESS TIS UNMANLY GRIEF
IT SHOWS A WILL MOST INCORRECT TO HEAVEN
A HEART UNFORTIFIED A MIND IMPATIENT
AN UNDERSTANDING SIMPLE AND UNSCHOOLD
FOR WHAT WE KNOW MUST BE AND IS AS COMMON
AS ANY THE MOST VULGAR THING TO SENSE
WHY SHOULD WE IN OUR PEEVISH OPPOSITION
TAKE IT TO HEART FIE  TIS A FAULT TO HEAVEN
A FAULT AGAINST THE DEAD A FAULT TO NATURE
TO REASON MOST ABSURD WHOSE COMMON THEME

HYPERION TO A SATYR SO LOVING TO MY MOTHER
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BETEEM THE WINDS OF HEAVEN
VISIT HER FACE TOO ROUGHLY  HEAVEN AND EARTH

BY WHAT IT FED ON AND YET WITHIN A MONTH 
LET ME NOT THINK ONT FRAILTY THY NAME IS WOMAN  
A LITTLE MONTH OR ERE THOSE SHOES WERE OLD
WITH WHICH SHE FOLLOWD MY POOR FATHERS BODY

TWO NIGHTS TOGETHER HAD THESE GENTLEMEN
MARCELLUS AND BERNARDO ON THEIR WATCH
IN THE DEAD VAST AND MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
BEEN THUS ENCOUNTERD  A FIGURE LIKE YOUR FATHER
ARMED AT POINT EXACTLY CAPAPE
APPEARS BEFORE THEM AND WITH SOLEMN MARCH
GOES SLOW AND STATELY BY THEM THRICE HE WALKD
BY THEIR OPPRESSD AND FEARSURPRISED EYES
WITHIN HIS TRUNCHEONS LENGTH WHILST THEY DISTILLED
ALMOST TO JELLY WITH THE ACT OF FEAR
STAND DUMB AND SPEAK NOT TO HIM  THIS TO ME
IN DREADFUL SECRECY IMPART THEY DID
AND I WITH THEM THE THIRD NIGHT KEPT THE WATCH
WHERE AS THEY HAD DELIVERD BOTH IN TIME
FORM OF THE THING EACH WORD MADE TRUE AND GOOD
THE APPARITION COMES I KNEW YOUR FATHER
THESE HANDS ARE NOT MORE LIKE 
BUT WHERE WAS THIS
MY LORD UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE WE WATCHD 
DID YOU NOT SPEAK TO IT
MY LORD I DID
BUT ANSWER MADE IT NONE YET ONCE METHOUGHT
IT LIFTED UP ITS HEAD AND DID ADDRESS
ITSELF TO MOTION LIKE AS IT WOULD SPEAK
BUT EVEN THEN THE MORNING COCK CREW LOUD
AND AT THE SOUND IT SHRUNK IN HASTE AWAY
AND VANISHD FROM OUR SIGHT 
TIS VERY STRANGE 
AS I DO LIVE MY HONOURD LORD TIS TRUE
AND WE DID THINK IT WRIT DOWN IN OUR DUTY
TO LET YOU KNOW OF IT 
INDEED INDEED SIRS BUT THIS TROUBLES ME 
HOLD YOU THE WATCH TONIGHT
WE DO MY LORD 
ARMD SAY YOU
ARMD MY LORD 
FROM TOP TO TOE
MY LORD FROM HEAD TO FOOT 
THEN SAW YOU NOT HIS FACE
O YES MY LORD HE WORE HIS BEAVER UP 
WHAT LOOKD HE FROWNINGLY
A COUNTENANCE MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER 
PALE OR RED
NAY VERY PALE 
AND FIXD HIS EYES UPON YOU
MOST CONSTANTLY 
I WOULD I HAD BEEN THERE 
IT WOULD HAVE MUCH AMAZED YOU 
VERY LIKE VERY LIKE  STAYD IT LONG
WHILE ONE WITH MODERATE HASTE MIGHT TELL A HUNDRED 
LONGER LONGER 
NOT WHEN I SAWT 
HIS BEARD WAS GRIZZLED NO

A SABLE SILVERD 
I WILL WATCH TONIGHT

IF IT ASSUME MY NOBLE FATHERS PERSON
ILL SPEAK TO IT THOUGH HELL ITSELF SHOULD GAPE
AND BID ME HOLD MY PEACE  I PRAY YOU ALL
IF YOU HAVE HITHERTO CONCEALD THIS SIGHT
LET IT BE TENABLE IN YOUR SILENCE STILL
AND WHATSOEVER ELSE SHALL HAP TONIGHT

UPON THE PLATFORM TWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE
ILL VISIT YOU

TILL THEN SIT STILL MY SOUL FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE
THOUGH ALL THE EARTH OERWHELM THEM TO MENS EYES 
MY NECESSARIES ARE EMBARKD FAREWELL
AND SISTER AS THE WINDS GIVE BENEFIT
AND CONVOY IS ASSISTANT DO NOT SLEEP
BUT LET ME HEAR FROM YOU 
DO YOU DOUBT THAT
FOR HAMLET AND THE TRIFLING OF HIS FAVOUR
HOLD IT A FASHION AND A TOY IN BLOOD
A VIOLET IN THE YOUTH OF PRIMY NATURE
FORWARD NOT PERMANENT SWEET NOT LASTING
THE PERFUME AND SUPPLIANCE OF A MINUTE NO MORE 
NO MORE BUT SO
THINK IT NO MORE
FOR NATURE CRESCENT DOES NOT GROW ALONE
IN THEWS AND BULK BUT AS THIS TEMPLE WAXES
THE INWARD SERVICE OF THE MIND AND SOUL
GROWS WIDE WITHAL  PERHAPS HE LOVES YOU NOW
AND NOW NO SOIL NOR CAUTEL DOTH BESMIRCH
THE VIRTUE OF HIS WILL BUT YOU MUST FEAR
HIS GREATNESS WEIGHD HIS WILL IS NOT HIS OWN
FOR HE HIMSELF IS SUBJECT TO HIS BIRTH
HE MAY NOT AS UNVALUED PERSONS DO
CARVE FOR HIMSELF FOR ON HIS CHOICE DEPENDS
THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF THIS WHOLE STATE
AND THEREFORE MUST HIS CHOICE BE CIRCUMSCRIBED
UNTO THE VOICE AND YIELDING OF THAT BODY
WHEREOF HE IS THE HEAD  THEN IF HE SAYS HE LOVES YOU
IT FITS YOUR WISDOM SO FAR TO BELIEVE IT
AS HE IN HIS PARTICULAR ACT AND PLACE
MAY GIVE HIS SAYING DEED WHICH IS NO FURTHER
THAN THE MAIN VOICE OF DENMARK GOES WITHAL 
THEN WEIGH WHAT LOSS YOUR HONOUR MAY SUSTAIN
IF WITH TOO CREDENT EAR YOU LIST HIS SONGS
OR LOSE YOUR HEART OR YOUR CHASTE TREASURE OPEN
TO HIS UNMASTERD IMPORTUNITY 
FEAR IT OPHELIA FEAR IT MY DEAR SISTER
AND KEEP YOU IN THE REAR OF YOUR AFFECTION
OUT OF THE SHOT AND DANGER OF DESIRE 
THE CHARIEST MAID IS PRODIGAL ENOUGH
IF SHE UNMASK HER BEAUTY TO THE MOON
VIRTUE ITSELF SCAPES NOT CALUMNIOUS STROKES
THE CANKER GALLS THE INFANTS OF THE SPRING
TOO OFT BEFORE THEIR BUTTONS BE DISCLOSED
AND IN THE MORN AND LIQUID DEW OF YOUTH
CONTAGIOUS BLASTMENTS ARE MOST IMMINENT 
BE WARY THEN BEST SAFETY LIES IN FEAR
YOUTH TO ITSELF REBELS THOUGH NONE ELSE NEAR 
I SHALL THE EFFECT OF THIS GOOD LESSON KEEP
AS WATCHMAN TO MY HEART  BUT GOOD MY BROTHER
DO NOT AS SOME UNGRACIOUS PASTORS DO
SHOW ME THE STEEP AND THORNY WAY TO HEAVEN
WHILES LIKE A PUFFD AND RECKLESS LIBERTINE
HIMSELF THE PRIMROSE PATH OF DALLIANCE TREADS
AND RECKS NOT HIS OWN REDE 
O FEAR ME NOT 
I STAY TOO LONG BUT HERE MY FATHER COMES 
A DOUBLE BLESSING IS A DOUBLE GRACE
OCCASION SMILES UPON A SECOND LEAVE 
YET HERE LAERTES  ABOARD ABOARD FOR SHAME 
THE WIND SITS IN THE SHOULDER OF YOUR SAIL
AND YOU ARE STAYD FOR  THERE MY BLESSING WITH THEE 
AND THESE FEW PRECEPTS IN THY MEMORY
SEE THOU CHARACTER  GIVE THY THOUGHTS NO TONGUE
NOR ANY UNPROPORTIONED THOUGHT HIS ACT 
BE THOU FAMILIAR BUT BY NO MEANS VULGAR 
THOSE FRIENDS THOU HAST AND THEIR ADOPTION TRIED
GRAPPLE THEM TO THY SOUL WITH HOOPS OF STEEL
BUT DO NOT DULL THY PALM WITH ENTERTAINMENT
OF EACH NEWHATCHD UNFLEDGED COMRADE  BEWARE
OF ENTRANCE TO A QUARREL BUT BEING IN
BEART THAT THE OPPOSED MAY BEWARE OF THEE 
GIVE EVERY MAN THY EAR BUT FEW THY VOICE
TAKE EACH MANS CENSURE BUT RESERVE THY JUDGMENT 
COSTLY THY HABIT AS THY PURSE CAN BUY
BUT NOT EXPRESSD IN FANCY RICH NOT GAUDY
FOR THE APPAREL OFT PROCLAIMS THE MAN
AND THEY IN FRANCE OF THE BEST RANK AND STATION
ARE OF A MOST SELECT AND GENEROUS CHIEF IN THAT 
NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
FOR LOAN OFT LOSES BOTH ITSELF AND FRIEND
AND BORROWING DULLS THE EDGE OF HUSBANDRY 
THIS ABOVE ALL TO THINE OWNSELF BE TRUE
AND IT MUST FOLLOW AS THE NIGHT THE DAY
THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN 
FAREWELL MY BLESSING SEASON THIS IN THEE 
MOST HUMBLY DO I TAKE MY LEAVE MY LORD 
THE TIME INVITES YOU GO YOUR SERVANTS TEND 
FAREWELL OPHELIA AND REMEMBER WELL
WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU 
TIS IN MY MEMORY LOCKD
AND YOU YOURSELF SHALL KEEP THE KEY OF IT 
FAREWELL 
WHAT IST OPHELIA BE HATH SAID TO YOU
SO PLEASE YOU SOMETHING TOUCHING THE LORD HAMLET 
MARRY WELL BETHOUGHT
TIS TOLD ME HE HATH VERY OFT OF LATE
GIVEN PRIVATE TIME TO YOU AND YOU YOURSELF
HAVE OF YOUR AUDIENCE BEEN MOST FREE AND BOUNTEOUS
IF IT BE SO AS SO TIS PUT ON ME
AND THAT IN WAY OF CAUTION I MUST TELL YOU
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOURSELF SO CLEARLY
AS IT BEHOVES MY DAUGHTER AND YOUR HONOUR 
WHAT IS BETWEEN YOU GIVE ME UP THE TRUTH 
HE HATH MY LORD OF LATE MADE MANY TENDERS
OF HIS AFFECTION TO ME 
AFFECTION  POOH  YOU SPEAK LIKE A GREEN GIRL
UNSIFTED IN SUCH PERILOUS CIRCUMSTANCE 
DO YOU BELIEVE HIS TENDERS AS YOU CALL THEM
I DO NOT KNOW MY LORD WHAT I SHOULD THINK 
MARRY ILL TEACH YOU THINK YOURSELF A BABY
THAT YOU HAVE TAEN THESE TENDERS FOR TRUE PAY
WHICH ARE NOT STERLING  TENDER YOURSELF MORE DEARLY
OR NOT TO CRACK THE WIND OF THE POOR PHRASE
RUNNING IT THUS YOULL TENDER ME A FOOL 
MY LORD HE HATH IMPORTUNED ME WITH LOVE
IN HONOURABLE FASHION 
AY FASHION YOU MAY CALL IT GO TO GO TO 
AND HATH GIVEN COUNTENANCE TO HIS SPEECH MY LORD
WITH ALMOST ALL THE HOLY VOWS OF HEAVEN 
AY SPRINGES TO CATCH WOODCOCKS  I DO KNOW
WHEN THE BLOOD BURNS HOW PRODIGAL THE SOUL
LENDS THE TONGUE VOWS THESE BLAZES DAUGHTER
GIVING MORE LIGHT THAN HEAT EXTINCT IN BOTH
EVEN IN THEIR PROMISE AS IT IS AMAKING
YOU MUST NOT TAKE FOR FIRE  FROM THIS TIME
BE SOMEWHAT SCANTER OF YOUR MAIDEN PRESENCE
SET YOUR ENTREATMENTS AT A HIGHER RATE
THAN A COMMAND TO PARLEY  FOR LORD HAMLET
BELIEVE SO MUCH IN HIM THAT HE IS YOUNG
AND WITH A LARGER TETHER MAY HE WALK
THAN MAY BE GIVEN YOU IN FEW OPHELIA
DO NOT BELIEVE HIS VOWS FOR THEY ARE BROKERS
NOT OF THAT DYE WHICH THEIR INVESTMENTS SHOW
BUT MERE IMPLORATORS OF UNHOLY SUITS
BREATHING LIKE SANCTIFIED AND PIOUS BAWDS
THE BETTER TO BEGUILE  THIS IS FOR ALL
I WOULD NOT IN PLAIN TERMS FROM THIS TIME FORTH
HAVE YOU SO SLANDER ANY MOMENT LEISURE
AS TO GIVE WORDS OR TALK WITH THE LORD HAMLET 
LOOK TOT I CHARGE YOU COME YOUR WAYS 
I SHALL OBEY MY LORD 
THE AIR BITES SHREWDLY IT IS VERY COLD 
IT IS A NIPPING AND AN EAGER AIR 
WHAT HOUR NOW
I THINK IT LACKS OF TWELVE 
NO IT IS STRUCK 
INDEED I HEARD IT NOT THEN IT DRAWS NEAR THE SEASON
WHEREIN THE SPIRIT HELD HIS WONT TO WALK 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MY LORD
THE KING DOTH WAKE TONIGHT AND TAKES HIS ROUSE
KEEPS WASSAIL AND THE SWAGGERING UPSPRING REELS
AND AS HE DRAINS HIS DRAUGHTS OF RHENISH DOWN
THE KETTLEDRUM AND TRUMPET THUS BRAY OUT
THE TRIUMPH OF HIS PLEDGE 
IS IT A CUSTOM
AY MARRY IST
BUT TO MY MIND THOUGH I AM NATIVE HERE
AND TO THE MANNER BORN IT IS A CUSTOM
MORE HONOURD IN THE BREACH THAN THE OBSERVANCE 
THIS HEAVYHEADED REVEL EAST AND WEST
MAKES US TRADUCED AND TAXD OF OTHER NATIONS
THEY CLEPE US DRUNKARDS AND WITH SWINISH PHRASE
SOIL OUR ADDITION AND INDEED IT TAKES
FROM OUR ACHIEVEMENTS THOUGH PERFORMD AT HEIGHT
THE PITH AND MARROW OF OUR ATTRIBUTE 
SO OFT IT CHANCES IN PARTICULAR MEN
THAT FOR SOME VICIOUS MOLE OF NATURE IN THEM
AS IN THEIR BIRTH WHEREIN THEY ARE NOT GUILTY
SINCE NATURE CANNOT CHOOSE HIS ORIGIN 
BY THE OERGROWTH OF SOME COMPLEXION
OFT BREAKING DOWN THE PALES AND FORTS OF REASON
OR BY SOME HABIT THAT TOO MUCH OERLEAVENS
THE FORM OF PLAUSIVE MANNERS THAT THESE MEN
CARRYING I SAY THE STAMP OF ONE DEFECT
BEING NATURES LIVERY OR FORTUNES STAR 
THEIR VIRTUES ELSE BE THEY AS PURE AS GRACE
AS INFINITE AS MAN MAY UNDERGO 
SHALL IN THE GENERAL CENSURE TAKE CORRUPTION
FROM THAT PARTICULAR FAULT THE DRAM OF EALE
DOTH ALL THE NOBLE SUBSTANCE OF A DOUBT
TO HIS OWN SCANDAL 
LOOK MY LORD IT COMES 
ANGELS AND MINISTERS OF GRACE DEFEND US 
BE THOU A SPIRIT OF HEALTH OR GOBLIN DAMND
BRING WITH THEE AIRS FROM HEAVEN OR BLASTS FROM HELL
BE THY INTENTS WICKED OR CHARITABLE
THOU COMEST IN SUCH A QUESTIONABLE SHAPE
THAT I WILL SPEAK TO THEE ILL CALL THEE HAMLET
KING FATHER ROYAL DANE O ANSWER ME 
LET ME NOT BURST IN IGNORANCE BUT TELL
WHY THY CANONIZED BONES HEARSED IN DEATH
HAVE BURST THEIR CEREMENTS WHY THE SEPULCHRE
WHEREIN WE SAW THEE QUIETLY INURND
HATH OPED HIS PONDEROUS AND MARBLE JAWS
TO CAST THEE UP AGAIN  WHAT MAY THIS MEAN
THAT THOU DEAD CORSE AGAIN IN COMPLETE STEEL
REVISITST THUS THE GLIMPSES OF THE MOON
MAKING NIGHT HIDEOUS AND WE FOOLS OF NATURE
SO HORRIDLY TO SHAKE OUR DISPOSITION
WITH THOUGHTS BEYOND THE REACHES OF OUR SOULS
SAY WHY IS THIS WHEREFORE WHAT SHOULD WE DO
IT BECKONS YOU TO GO AWAY WITH IT
AS IF IT SOME IMPARTMENT DID DESIRE
TO YOU ALONE 
LOOK WITH WHAT COURTEOUS ACTION
IT WAVES YOU TO A MORE REMOVED GROUND
BUT DO NOT GO WITH IT 
NO BY NO MEANS 
IT WILL NOT SPEAK THEN I WILL FOLLOW IT 
DO NOT MY LORD 
WHY WHAT SHOULD BE THE FEAR
I DO NOT SET MY LIFE IN A PINS FEE
AND FOR MY SOUL WHAT CAN IT DO TO THAT
BEING A THING IMMORTAL AS ITSELF

O HAMLET WHAT A FALLINGOFF WAS THERE 
FROM ME WHOSE LOVE WAS OF THAT DIGNITY

HOLDS SUCH AN ENMITY WITH BLOOD OF MAN
THAT SWIFT AS QUICKSILVER IT COURSES THROUGH
THE NATURAL GATES AND ALLEYS OF THE BODY
AND WITH A SUDDEN VIGOUR DOTH POSSET
AND CURD LIKE EAGER DROPPINGS INTO MILK
THE THIN AND WHOLESOME BLOOD SO DID IT MINE
AND A MOST INSTANT TETTER BARKD ABOUT
MOST LAZARLIKE WITH VILE AND LOATHSOME CRUST
ALL MY SMOOTH BODY 
THUS WAS I SLEEPING BY A BROTHERS HAND
OF LIFE OF CROWN OF QUEEN AT ONCE DISPATCHD
CUT OFF EVEN IN THE BLOSSOMS OF MY SIN
UNHOUSELD DISAPPOINTED UNANELD
NO RECKONING MADE BUT SENT TO MY ACCOUNT
WITH ALL MY IMPERFECTIONS ON MY HEAD
O HORRIBLE  O HORRIBLE  MOST HORRIBLE 
IF THOU HAST NATURE IN THEE BEAR IT NOT
LET NOT THE ROYAL BED OF DENMARK BE
A COUCH FOR LUXURY AND DAMNED INCEST

AGAINST THY MOTHER AUGHT LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN
AND TO THOSE THORNS THAT IN HER BOSOM LODGE

FOR OUT O DOORS HE WENT WITHOUT THEIR HELPS
AND TO THE LAST BENDED THEIR LIGHT ON ME 
COME GO WITH ME I WILL GO SEEK THE KING

WHAT HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM ANY HARD WORDS OF LATE

TO THINK MY LORD IF YOU DELIGHT NOT IN MAN WHAT
LENTEN ENTERTAINMENT THE PLAYERS SHALL RECEIVE FROM
YOU WE COTED THEM ON THE WAY AND HITHER ARE THEY
COMING TO OFFER YOU SERVICE 
HE THAT PLAYS THE KING SHALL BE WELCOME HIS MAJESTY
SHALL HAVE TRIBUTE OF ME THE ADVENTUROUS KNIGHT
SHALL USE HIS FOIL AND TARGET THE LOVER SHALL NOT
SIGH GRATIS THE HUMOUROUS MAN SHALL END HIS PART
IN PEACE THE CLOWN SHALL MAKE THOSE LAUGH WHOSE
LUNGS ARE TICKLED O THE SERE AND THE LADY SHALL
SAY HER MIND FREELY OR THE BLANK VERSE SHALL HALT
FORT  WHAT PLAYERS ARE THEY
EVEN THOSE YOU WERE WONT TO TAKE DELIGHT IN THE
TRAGEDIANS OF THE CITY 
HOW CHANCES IT THEY TRAVEL THEIR RESIDENCE BOTH
IN REPUTATION AND PROFIT WAS BETTER BOTH WAYS 
I THINK THEIR INHIBITION COMES BY THE MEANS OF THE
LATE INNOVATION 
DO THEY HOLD THE SAME ESTIMATION THEY DID WHEN I WAS
IN THE CITY ARE THEY SO FOLLOWED
NO INDEED ARE THEY NOT 
HOW COMES IT DO THEY GROW RUSTY
NAY THEIR ENDEAVOUR KEEPS IN THE WONTED PACE BUT
THERE IS SIR AN AERY OF CHILDREN LITTLE EYASES
THAT CRY OUT ON THE TOP OF QUESTION AND ARE MOST
TYRANNICALLY CLAPPED FORT THESE ARE NOW THE
FASHION AND SO BERATTLE THE COMMON STAGES SO THEY
CALL THEM THAT MANY WEARING RAPIERS ARE AFRAID OF
GOOSEQUILLS AND DARE SCARCE COME THITHER 
WHAT ARE THEY CHILDREN WHO MAINTAINS EM HOW ARE
THEY ESCOTED WILL THEY PURSUE THE QUALITY NO
LONGER THAN THEY CAN SING WILL THEY NOT SAY
AFTERWARDS IF THEY SHOULD GROW THEMSELVES TO COMMON
PLAYERS AS IT IS MOST LIKE IF THEIR MEANS ARE NO
BETTER THEIR WRITERS DO THEM WRONG TO MAKE THEM
EXCLAIM AGAINST THEIR OWN SUCCESSION
FAITH THERE HAS BEEN MUCH TO DO ON BOTH SIDES AND
THE NATION HOLDS IT NO SIN TO TARRE THEM TO
CONTROVERSY THERE WAS FOR A WHILE NO MONEY BID
FOR ARGUMENT UNLESS THE POET AND THE PLAYER WENT TO
CUFFS IN THE QUESTION 
IST POSSIBLE
O THERE HAS BEEN MUCH THROWING ABOUT OF BRAINS 
DO THE BOYS CARRY IT AWAY
AY THAT THEY DO MY LORD HERCULES AND HIS LOAD TOO 
IT IS NOT VERY STRANGE FOR MINE UNCLE IS KING OF
DENMARK AND THOSE THAT WOULD MAKE MOWS AT HIM WHILE
MY FATHER LIVED GIVE TWENTY FORTY FIFTY AN
HUNDRED DUCATS APIECE FOR HIS PICTURE IN LITTLE 
SBLOOD THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS MORE THAN

I HEARD THEE SPEAK ME A SPEECH ONCE BUT IT WAS
NEVER ACTED OR IF IT WAS NOT ABOVE ONCE FOR THE
PLAY I REMEMBER PLEASED NOT THE MILLION TWAS
CAVIARE TO THE GENERAL BUT IT WAS AS I RECEIVED
IT AND OTHERS WHOSE JUDGMENTS IN SUCH MATTERS
CRIED IN THE TOP OF MINE AN EXCELLENT PLAY WELL
DIGESTED IN THE SCENES SET DOWN WITH AS MUCH
MODESTY AS CUNNING  I REMEMBER ONE SAID THERE
WERE NO SALLETS IN THE LINES TO MAKE THE MATTER
SAVOURY NOR NO MATTER IN THE PHRASE THAT MIGHT
INDICT THE AUTHOR OF AFFECTATION BUT CALLED IT AN
HONEST METHOD AS WHOLESOME AS SWEET AND BY VERY
MUCH MORE HANDSOME THAN FINE  ONE SPEECH IN IT I
CHIEFLY LOVED TWAS AENEAS TALE TO DIDO AND
THEREABOUT OF IT ESPECIALLY WHERE HE SPEAKS OF
PRIAMS SLAUGHTER IF IT LIVE IN YOUR MEMORY BEGIN
AT THIS LINE LET ME SEE LET ME SEE 
THE RUGGED PYRRHUS LIKE THE HYRCANIAN BEAST 
IT IS NOT SO IT BEGINS WITH PYRRHUS 
THE RUGGED PYRRHUS HE WHOSE SABLE ARMS
BLACK AS HIS PURPOSE DID THE NIGHT RESEMBLE
WHEN HE LAY COUCHED IN THE OMINOUS HORSE
HATH NOW THIS DREAD AND BLACK COMPLEXION SMEARD
WITH HERALDRY MORE DISMAL HEAD TO FOOT
NOW IS HE TOTAL GULES HORRIDLY TRICKD
WITH BLOOD OF FATHERS MOTHERS DAUGHTERS SONS
BAKED AND IMPASTED WITH THE PARCHING STREETS
THAT LEND A TYRANNOUS AND DAMNED LIGHT
TO THEIR LORDS MURDER ROASTED IN WRATH AND FIRE
AND THUS OERSIZED WITH COAGULATE GORE
WITH EYES LIKE CARBUNCLES THE HELLISH PYRRHUS
OLD GRANDSIRE PRIAM SEEKS 
SO PROCEED YOU 
FORE GOD MY LORD WELL SPOKEN WITH GOOD ACCENT AND
GOOD DISCRETION 
ANON HE FINDS HIM
STRIKING TOO SHORT AT GREEKS HIS ANTIQUE SWORD
REBELLIOUS TO HIS ARM LIES WHERE IT FALLS
REPUGNANT TO COMMAND UNEQUAL MATCHD
PYRRHUS AT PRIAM DRIVES IN RAGE STRIKES WIDE
BUT WITH THE WHIFF AND WIND OF HIS FELL SWORD
THE UNNERVED FATHER FALLS  THEN SENSELESS ILIUM
SEEMING TO FEEL THIS BLOW WITH FLAMING TOP
STOOPS TO HIS BASE AND WITH A HIDEOUS CRASH
TAKES PRISONER PYRRHUS EAR FOR LO  HIS SWORD
WHICH WAS DECLINING ON THE MILKY HEAD
OF REVEREND PRIAM SEEMD I THE AIR TO STICK
SO AS A PAINTED TYRANT PYRRHUS STOOD
AND LIKE A NEUTRAL TO HIS WILL AND MATTER
DID NOTHING 
BUT AS WE OFTEN SEE AGAINST SOME STORM
A SILENCE IN THE HEAVENS THE RACK STAND STILL
THE BOLD WINDS SPEECHLESS AND THE ORB BELOW
AS HUSH AS DEATH ANON THE DREADFUL THUNDER
DOTH REND THE REGION SO AFTER PYRRHUS PAUSE
AROUSED VENGEANCE SETS HIM NEW AWORK
AND NEVER DID THE CYCLOPS HAMMERS FALL
ON MARSS ARMOUR FORGED FOR PROOF ETERNE
WITH LESS REMORSE THAN PYRRHUS BLEEDING SWORD
NOW FALLS ON PRIAM 
OUT OUT THOU STRUMPET FORTUNE  ALL YOU GODS
IN GENERAL SYNOD TAKE AWAY HER POWER
BREAK ALL THE SPOKES AND FELLIES FROM HER WHEEL
AND BOWL THE ROUND NAVE DOWN THE HILL OF HEAVEN
AS LOW AS TO THE FIENDS 
THIS IS TOO LONG 
IT SHALL TO THE BARBERS WITH YOUR BEARD  PRITHEE
SAY ON HES FOR A JIG OR A TALE OF BAWDRY OR HE
SLEEPS SAY ON COME TO HECUBA 
BUT WHO O WHO HAD SEEN THE MOBLED QUEEN 
THE MOBLED QUEEN
THATS GOOD MOBLED QUEEN IS GOOD 
RUN BAREFOOT UP AND DOWN THREATENING THE FLAMES
WITH BISSON RHEUM A CLOUT UPON THAT HEAD
WHERE LATE THE DIADEM STOOD AND FOR A ROBE
ABOUT HER LANK AND ALL OERTEEMED LOINS
A BLANKET IN THE ALARM OF FEAR CAUGHT UP
WHO THIS HAD SEEN WITH TONGUE IN VENOM STEEPD
GAINST FORTUNES STATE WOULD TREASON HAVE
PRONOUNCED
BUT IF THE GODS THEMSELVES DID SEE HER THEN
WHEN SHE SAW PYRRHUS MAKE MALICIOUS SPORT
IN MINCING WITH HIS SWORD HER HUSBANDS LIMBS
THE INSTANT BURST OF CLAMOUR THAT SHE MADE
UNLESS THINGS MORTAL MOVE THEM NOT AT ALL
WOULD HAVE MADE MILCH THE BURNING EYES OF HEAVEN
AND PASSION IN THE GODS 
LOOK WHETHER HE HAS NOT TURNED HIS COLOUR AND HAS
TEARS INS EYES  PRAY YOU NO MORE 
TIS WELL ILL HAVE THEE SPEAK OUT THE REST SOON 
GOOD MY LORD WILL YOU SEE THE PLAYERS WELL
BESTOWED DO YOU HEAR LET THEM BE WELL USED FOR

TIME AFTER YOUR DEATH YOU WERE BETTER HAVE A BAD
EPITAPH THAN THEIR ILL REPORT WHILE YOU LIVE

WITH FORMS TO HIS CONCEIT AND ALL FOR NOTHING 
FOR HECUBA 
WHATS HECUBA TO HIM OR HE TO HECUBA
THAT HE SHOULD WEEP FOR HER WHAT WOULD HE DO
HAD HE THE MOTIVE AND THE CUE FOR PASSION
THAT I HAVE HE WOULD DROWN THE STAGE WITH TEARS
AND CLEAVE THE GENERAL EAR WITH HORRID SPEECH
MAKE MAD THE GUILTY AND APPAL THE FREE
CONFOUND THE IGNORANT AND AMAZE INDEED
THE VERY FACULTIES OF EYES AND EARS  YET I

LIKE JOHNADREAMS UNPREGNANT OF MY CAUSE
AND CAN SAY NOTHING NO NOT FOR A KING
UPON WHOSE PROPERTY AND MOST DEAR LIFE
A DAMND DEFEAT WAS MADE  AM I A COWARD
WHO CALLS ME VILLAIN BREAKS MY PATE ACROSS
PLUCKS OFF MY BEARD AND BLOWS IT IN MY FACE
TWEAKS ME BY THE NOSE GIVES ME THE LIE I THE THROAT
AS DEEP AS TO THE LUNGS WHO DOES ME THIS
HA 
SWOUNDS I SHOULD TAKE IT FOR IT CANNOT BE
BUT I AM PIGEONLIVERD AND LACK GALL
TO MAKE OPPRESSION BITTER OR ERE THIS
I SHOULD HAVE FATTED ALL THE REGION KITES
WITH THIS SLAVES OFFAL BLOODY BAWDY VILLAIN 
REMORSELESS TREACHEROUS LECHEROUS KINDLESS VILLAIN 
O VENGEANCE 
WHY WHAT AN ASS AM I  THIS IS MOST BRAVE
THAT I THE SON OF A DEAR FATHER MURDERD
PROMPTED TO MY REVENGE BY HEAVEN AND HELL
MUST LIKE A WHORE UNPACK MY HEART WITH WORDS
AND FALL ACURSING LIKE A VERY DRAB
A SCULLION 
FIE UPONT  FOH  ABOUT MY BRAIN  I HAVE HEARD
THAT GUILTY CREATURES SITTING AT A PLAY
HAVE BY THE VERY CUNNING OF THE SCENE
BEEN STRUCK SO TO THE SOUL THAT PRESENTLY
THEY HAVE PROCLAIMD THEIR MALEFACTIONS
FOR MURDER THOUGH IT HAVE NO TONGUE WILL SPEAK
WITH MOST MIRACULOUS ORGAN  ILL HAVE THESE PLAYERS
PLAY SOMETHING LIKE THE MURDER OF MY FATHER
BEFORE MINE UNCLE ILL OBSERVE HIS LOOKS
ILL TENT HIM TO THE QUICK IF HE BUT BLENCH
I KNOW MY COURSE  THE SPIRIT THAT I HAVE SEEN
MAY BE THE DEVIL AND THE DEVIL HATH POWER
TO ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE YEA AND PERHAPS
OUT OF MY WEAKNESS AND MY MELANCHOLY
AS HE IS VERY POTENT WITH SUCH SPIRITS
ABUSES ME TO DAMN ME ILL HAVE GROUNDS
MORE RELATIVE THAN THIS THE PLAY S THE THING
WHEREIN ILL CATCH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING 
AND CAN YOU BY NO DRIFT OF CIRCUMSTANCE
GET FROM HIM WHY HE PUTS ON THIS CONFUSION
GRATING SO HARSHLY ALL HIS DAYS OF QUIET
WITH TURBULENT AND DANGEROUS LUNACY
HE DOES CONFESS HE FEELS HIMSELF DISTRACTED
BUT FROM WHAT CAUSE HE WILL BY NO MEANS SPEAK 
NOR DO WE FIND HIM FORWARD TO BE SOUNDED
BUT WITH A CRAFTY MADNESS KEEPS ALOOF
WHEN WE WOULD BRING HIM ON TO SOME CONFESSION
OF HIS TRUE STATE 
DID HE RECEIVE YOU WELL
MOST LIKE A GENTLEMAN 
BUT WITH MUCH FORCING OF HIS DISPOSITION 
NIGGARD OF QUESTION BUT OF OUR DEMANDS
MOST FREE IN HIS REPLY 
DID YOU ASSAY HIM
TO ANY PASTIME
MADAM IT SO FELL OUT THAT CERTAIN PLAYERS
WE OERRAUGHT ON THE WAY OF THESE WE TOLD HIM
AND THERE DID SEEM IN HIM A KIND OF JOY
TO HEAR OF IT THEY ARE ABOUT THE COURT
AND AS I THINK THEY HAVE ALREADY ORDER
THIS NIGHT TO PLAY BEFORE HIM 
TIS MOST TRUE
AND HE BESEECHD ME TO ENTREAT YOUR MAJESTIES
TO HEAR AND SEE THE MATTER 
WITH ALL MY HEART AND IT DOTH MUCH CONTENT ME
TO HEAR HIM SO INCLINED 
GOOD GENTLEMEN GIVE HIM A FURTHER EDGE
AND DRIVE HIS PURPOSE ON TO THESE DELIGHTS 
WE SHALL MY LORD 
SWEET GERTRUDE LEAVE US TOO
FOR WE HAVE CLOSELY SENT FOR HAMLET HITHER
THAT HE AS TWERE BY ACCIDENT MAY HERE
AFFRONT OPHELIA
HER FATHER AND MYSELF LAWFUL ESPIALS
WILL SO BESTOW OURSELVES THAT SEEING UNSEEN
WE MAY OF THEIR ENCOUNTER FRANKLY JUDGE
AND GATHER BY HIM AS HE IS BEHAVED
IF T BE THE AFFLICTION OF HIS LOVE OR NO
THAT THUS HE SUFFERS FOR 
I SHALL OBEY YOU 
AND FOR YOUR PART OPHELIA I DO WISH
THAT YOUR GOOD BEAUTIES BE THE HAPPY CAUSE
OF HAMLETS WILDNESS SO SHALL I HOPE YOUR VIRTUES
WILL BRING HIM TO HIS WONTED WAY AGAIN
TO BOTH YOUR HONOURS 
MADAM I WISH IT MAY 
OPHELIA WALK YOU HERE  GRACIOUS SO PLEASE YOU
WE WILL BESTOW OURSELVES 
READ ON THIS BOOK
THAT SHOW OF SUCH AN EXERCISE MAY COLOUR
YOUR LONELINESS  WE ARE OFT TO BLAME IN THIS 
TIS TOO MUCH PROVED THAT WITH DEVOTIONS VISAGE
AND PIOUS ACTION WE DO SUGAR OER
THE DEVIL HIMSELF 
          O TIS TOO TRUE 
HOW SMART A LASH THAT SPEECH DOTH GIVE MY CONSCIENCE 
THE HARLOTS CHEEK BEAUTIED WITH PLASTERING ART
IS NOT MORE UGLY TO THE THING THAT HELPS IT
THAN IS MY DEED TO MY MOST PAINTED WORD
O HEAVY BURTHEN 
I HEAR HIM COMING LETS WITHDRAW MY LORD 
TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION
WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE
OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES
AND BY OPPOSING END THEM TO DIE TO SLEEP
NO MORE AND BY A SLEEP TO SAY WE END
THE HEARTACHE AND THE THOUSAND NATURAL SHOCKS
THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO TIS A CONSUMMATION
DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHD  TO DIE TO SLEEP
TO SLEEP PERCHANCE TO DREAM AY THERES THE RUB
FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
WHEN WE HAVE SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL
MUST GIVE US PAUSE THERES THE RESPECT
THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG LIFE
FOR WHO WOULD BEAR THE WHIPS AND SCORNS OF TIME
THE OPPRESSORS WRONG THE PROUD MANS CONTUMELY
THE PANGS OF DESPISED LOVE THE LAWS DELAY
THE INSOLENCE OF OFFICE AND THE SPURNS
THAT PATIENT MERIT OF THE UNWORTHY TAKES
WHEN HE HIMSELF MIGHT HIS QUIETUS MAKE
WITH A BARE BODKIN WHO WOULD FARDELS BEAR
TO GRUNT AND SWEAT UNDER A WEARY LIFE
BUT THAT THE DREAD OF SOMETHING AFTER DEATH
THE UNDISCOVERD COUNTRY FROM WHOSE BOURN
NO TRAVELLER RETURNS PUZZLES THE WILL
AND MAKES US RATHER BEAR THOSE ILLS WE HAVE
THAN FLY TO OTHERS THAT WE KNOW NOT OF
THUS CONSCIENCE DOES MAKE COWARDS OF US ALL
AND THUS THE NATIVE HUE OF RESOLUTION
IS SICKLIED OER WITH THE PALE CAST OF THOUGHT
AND ENTERPRISES OF GREAT PITH AND MOMENT
WITH THIS REGARD THEIR CURRENTS TURN AWRY
AND LOSE THE NAME OF ACTION  SOFT YOU NOW 
THE FAIR OPHELIA  NYMPH IN THY ORISONS
BE ALL MY SINS REMEMBERD 
GOOD MY LORD

NOW WHAT MY LOVE IS PROOF HATH MADE YOU KNOW
AND AS MY LOVE IS SIZED MY FEAR IS SO
WHERE LOVE IS GREAT THE LITTLEST DOUBTS ARE FEAR
WHERE LITTLE FEARS GROW GREAT GREAT LOVE GROWS THERE 
FAITH I MUST LEAVE THEE LOVE AND SHORTLY TOO
MY OPERANT POWERS THEIR FUNCTIONS LEAVE TO DO
AND THOU SHALT LIVE IN THIS FAIR WORLD BEHIND
HONOURD BELOVED AND HAPLY ONE AS KIND
FOR HUSBAND SHALT THOU 
O CONFOUND THE REST 
SUCH LOVE MUST NEEDS BE TREASON IN MY BREAST
IN SECOND HUSBAND LET ME BE ACCURST 
NONE WED THE SECOND BUT WHO KILLD THE FIRST 
  WORMWOOD WORMWOOD 
THE INSTANCES THAT SECOND MARRIAGE MOVE
ARE BASE RESPECTS OF THRIFT BUT NONE OF LOVE
A SECOND TIME I KILL MY HUSBAND DEAD
WHEN SECOND HUSBAND KISSES ME IN BED 
I DO BELIEVE YOU THINK WHAT NOW YOU SPEAK
BUT WHAT WE DO DETERMINE OFT WE BREAK 
PURPOSE IS BUT THE SLAVE TO MEMORY
OF VIOLENT BIRTH BUT POOR VALIDITY
WHICH NOW LIKE FRUIT UNRIPE STICKS ON THE TREE
BUT FALL UNSHAKEN WHEN THEY MELLOW BE 
MOST NECESSARY TIS THAT WE FORGET
TO PAY OURSELVES WHAT TO OURSELVES IS DEBT
WHAT TO OURSELVES IN PASSION WE PROPOSE
THE PASSION ENDING DOTH THE PURPOSE LOSE 
THE VIOLENCE OF EITHER GRIEF OR JOY
THEIR OWN ENACTURES WITH THEMSELVES DESTROY
WHERE JOY MOST REVELS GRIEF DOTH MOST LAMENT
GRIEF JOYS JOY GRIEVES ON SLENDER ACCIDENT 
THIS WORLD IS NOT FOR AYE NOR TIS NOT STRANGE
THAT EVEN OUR LOVES SHOULD WITH OUR FORTUNES CHANGE
FOR TIS A QUESTION LEFT US YET TO PROVE
WHETHER LOVE LEAD FORTUNE OR ELSE FORTUNE LOVE 
THE GREAT MAN DOWN YOU MARK HIS FAVOURITE FLIES
THE POOR ADVANCED MAKES FRIENDS OF ENEMIES 
AND HITHERTO DOTH LOVE ON FORTUNE TEND
FOR WHO NOT NEEDS SHALL NEVER LACK A FRIEND
AND WHO IN WANT A HOLLOW FRIEND DOTH TRY
DIRECTLY SEASONS HIM HIS ENEMY 
BUT ORDERLY TO END WHERE I BEGUN
OUR WILLS AND FATES DO SO CONTRARY RUN
THAT OUR DEVICES STILL ARE OVERTHROWN
OUR THOUGHTS ARE OURS THEIR ENDS NONE OF OUR OWN
SO THINK THOU WILT NO SECOND HUSBAND WED
BUT DIE THY THOUGHTS WHEN THY FIRST LORD IS DEAD 
NOR EARTH TO ME GIVE FOOD NOR HEAVEN LIGHT 
SPORT AND REPOSE LOCK FROM ME DAY AND NIGHT 
TO DESPERATION TURN MY TRUST AND HOPE 
AN ANCHORS CHEER IN PRISON BE MY SCOPE 
EACH OPPOSITE THAT BLANKS THE FACE OF JOY
MEET WHAT I WOULD HAVE WELL AND IT DESTROY 
BOTH HERE AND HENCE PURSUE ME LASTING STRIFE
IF ONCE A WIDOW EVER I BE WIFE 
IF SHE SHOULD BREAK IT NOW 
TIS DEEPLY SWORN  SWEET LEAVE ME HERE AWHILE
MY SPIRITS GROW DULL AND FAIN I WOULD BEGUILE
THE TEDIOUS DAY WITH SLEEP 
SLEEP ROCK THY BRAIN
AND NEVER COME MISCHANCE BETWEEN US TWAIN

THE SINGLE AND PECULIAR LIFE IS BOUND
WITH ALL THE STRENGTH AND ARMOUR OF THE MIND
TO KEEP ITSELF FROM NOYANCE BUT MUCH MORE
THAT SPIRIT UPON WHOSE WEAL DEPEND AND REST
THE LIVES OF MANY  THE CEASE OF MAJESTY
DIES NOT ALONE BUT LIKE A GULF DOTH DRAW
WHATS NEAR IT WITH IT IT IS A MASSY WHEEL
FIXD ON THE SUMMIT OF THE HIGHEST MOUNT
TO WHOSE HUGE SPOKES TEN THOUSAND LESSER THINGS
ARE MORTISED AND ADJOIND WHICH WHEN IT FALLS
EACH SMALL ANNEXMENT PETTY CONSEQUENCE

SUCH AN ACT
THAT BLURS THE GRACE AND BLUSH OF MODESTY
CALLS VIRTUE HYPOCRITE TAKES OFF THE ROSE
FROM THE FAIR FOREHEAD OF AN INNOCENT LOVE
AND SETS A BLISTER THERE MAKES MARRIAGEVOWS
AS FALSE AS DICERS OATHS O SUCH A DEED
AS FROM THE BODY OF CONTRACTION PLUCKS
THE VERY SOUL AND SWEET RELIGION MAKES
A RHAPSODY OF WORDS HEAVENS FACE DOTH GLOW
YEA THIS SOLIDITY AND COMPOUND MASS
WITH TRISTFUL VISAGE AS AGAINST THE DOOM
IS THOUGHTSICK AT THE ACT 
AY ME WHAT ACT
THAT ROARS SO LOUD AND THUNDERS IN THE INDEX
LOOK HERE UPON THIS PICTURE AND ON THIS
THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF TWO BROTHERS 
SEE WHAT A GRACE WAS SEATED ON THIS BROW
HYPERIONS CURLS THE FRONT OF JOVE HIMSELF
AN EYE LIKE MARS TO THREATEN AND COMMAND
A STATION LIKE THE HERALD MERCURY
NEWLIGHTED ON A HEAVENKISSING HILL
A COMBINATION AND A FORM INDEED
WHERE EVERY GOD DID SEEM TO SET HIS SEAL
TO GIVE THE WORLD ASSURANCE OF A MAN
THIS WAS YOUR HUSBAND  LOOK YOU NOW WHAT FOLLOWS
HERE IS YOUR HUSBAND LIKE A MILDEWD EAR
BLASTING HIS WHOLESOME BROTHER  HAVE YOU EYES
COULD YOU ON THIS FAIR MOUNTAIN LEAVE TO FEED
AND BATTEN ON THIS MOOR HA  HAVE YOU EYES

THE HEYDAY IN THE BLOOD IS TAME ITS HUMBLE
AND WAITS UPON THE JUDGMENT AND WHAT JUDGMENT
WOULD STEP FROM THIS TO THIS SENSE SURE YOU HAVE
ELSE COULD YOU NOT HAVE MOTION BUT SURE THAT SENSE
IS APOPLEXD FOR MADNESS WOULD NOT ERR
NOR SENSE TO ECSTASY WAS NEER SO THRALLD
BUT IT RESERVED SOME QUANTITY OF CHOICE
TO SERVE IN SUCH A DIFFERENCE  WHAT DEVIL WAST

EYES WITHOUT FEELING FEELING WITHOUT SIGHT
EARS WITHOUT HANDS OR EYES SMELLING SANS ALL
OR BUT A SICKLY PART OF ONE TRUE SENSE

SINCE FROST ITSELF AS ACTIVELY DOTH BURN
AND REASON PANDERS WILL 
O HAMLET SPEAK NO MORE
THOU TURNST MINE EYES INTO MY VERY SOUL
AND THERE I SEE SUCH BLACK AND GRAINED SPOTS
AS WILL NOT LEAVE THEIR TINCT

WHO COMMANDS THEM SIR
THE NEPHEWS TO OLD NORWAY FORTINBRAS 
GOES IT AGAINST THE MAIN OF POLAND SIR
OR FOR SOME FRONTIER
TRULY TO SPEAK AND WITH NO ADDITION
WE GO TO GAIN A LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND
THAT HATH IN IT NO PROFIT BUT THE NAME 
TO PAY FIVE DUCATS FIVE I WOULD NOT FARM IT
NOR WILL IT YIELD TO NORWAY OR THE POLE
A RANKER RATE SHOULD IT BE SOLD IN FEE 
WHY THEN THE POLACK NEVER WILL DEFEND IT 
YES IT IS ALREADY GARRISOND 
TWO THOUSAND SOULS AND TWENTY THOUSAND DUCATS
WILL NOT DEBATE THE QUESTION OF THIS STRAW
THIS IS THE IMPOSTHUME OF MUCH WEALTH AND PEACE
THAT INWARD BREAKS AND SHOWS NO CAUSE WITHOUT
WHY THE MAN DIES  I HUMBLY THANK YOU SIR

ILL BE WITH YOU STRAIGHT GO A LITTLE BEFORE 
HOW ALL OCCASIONS DO INFORM AGAINST ME

SURE HE THAT MADE US WITH SUCH LARGE DISCOURSE
LOOKING BEFORE AND AFTER GAVE US NOT
THAT CAPABILITY AND GODLIKE REASON
TO FUST IN US UNUSED  NOW WHETHER IT BE
BESTIAL OBLIVION OR SOME CRAVEN SCRUPLE
OF THINKING TOO PRECISELY ON THE EVENT
A THOUGHT WHICH QUARTERD HATH BUT ONE PART WISDOM
AND EVER THREE PARTS COWARD I DO NOT KNOW
WHY YET I LIVE TO SAY THIS THINGS TO DO
SITH I HAVE CAUSE AND WILL AND STRENGTH AND MEANS
TO DOT  EXAMPLES GROSS AS EARTH EXHORT ME
WITNESS THIS ARMY OF SUCH MASS AND CHARGE
LED BY A DELICATE AND TENDER PRINCE
WHOSE SPIRIT WITH DIVINE AMBITION PUFFD
MAKES MOUTHS AT THE INVISIBLE EVENT
EXPOSING WHAT IS MORTAL AND UNSURE
TO ALL THAT FORTUNE DEATH AND DANGER DARE
EVEN FOR AN EGGSHELL  RIGHTLY TO BE GREAT
IS NOT TO STIR WITHOUT GREAT ARGUMENT
BUT GREATLY TO FIND QUARREL IN A STRAW
WHEN HONOURS AT THE STAKE  HOW STAND I THEN
THAT HAVE A FATHER KILLD A MOTHER STAIND
EXCITEMENTS OF MY REASON AND MY BLOOD
AND LET ALL SLEEP WHILE TO MY SHAME I SEE
THE IMMINENT DEATH OF TWENTY THOUSAND MEN
THAT FOR A FANTASY AND TRICK OF FAME
GO TO THEIR GRAVES LIKE BEDS FIGHT FOR A PLOT
WHEREON THE NUMBERS CANNOT TRY THE CAUSE
WHICH IS NOT TOMB ENOUGH AND CONTINENT
TO HIDE THE SLAIN O FROM THIS TIME FORTH
MY THOUGHTS BE BLOODY OR BE NOTHING WORTH 
I WILL NOT SPEAK WITH HER 
SHE IS IMPORTUNATE INDEED DISTRACT
HER MOOD WILL NEEDS BE PITIED 
WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE
SHE SPEAKS MUCH OF HER FATHER SAYS SHE HEARS
THERES TRICKS I THE WORLD AND HEMS AND BEATS HER HEART
SPURNS ENVIOUSLY AT STRAWS SPEAKS THINGS IN DOUBT
THAT CARRY BUT HALF SENSE HER SPEECH IS NOTHING
YET THE UNSHAPED USE OF IT DOTH MOVE
THE HEARERS TO COLLECTION THEY AIM AT IT
AND BOTCH THE WORDS UP FIT TO THEIR OWN THOUGHTS
WHICH AS HER WINKS AND NODS AND GESTURES
YIELD THEM
INDEED WOULD MAKE ONE THINK THERE MIGHT BE THOUGHT
THOUGH NOTHING SURE YET MUCH UNHAPPILY 
TWERE GOOD SHE WERE SPOKEN WITH FOR SHE MAY STREW
DANGEROUS CONJECTURES IN ILLBREEDING MINDS 
LET HER COME IN 
TO MY SICK SOUL AS SINS TRUE NATURE IS
EACH TOY SEEMS PROLOGUE TO SOME GREAT AMISS
SO FULL OF ARTLESS JEALOUSY IS GUILT
IT SPILLS ITSELF IN FEARING TO BE SPILT 
WHERE IS THE BEAUTEOUS MAJESTY OF DENMARK

PURSUED MY LIFE

WHY YOU PROCEEDED NOT AGAINST THESE FEATS
SO CRIMEFUL AND SO CAPITAL IN NATURE
AS BY YOUR SAFETY WISDOM ALL THINGS ELSE
YOU MAINLY WERE STIRRD UP 
O FOR TWO SPECIAL REASONS
WHICH MAY TO YOU PERHAPS SEEM MUCH UNSINEWD
BUT YET TO ME THEY ARE STRONG  THE QUEEN HIS MOTHER
LIVES ALMOST BY HIS LOOKS AND FOR MYSELF 
MY VIRTUE OR MY PLAGUE BE IT EITHER WHICH 
SHES SO CONJUNCTIVE TO MY LIFE AND SOUL
THAT AS THE STAR MOVES NOT BUT IN HIS SPHERE
I COULD NOT BUT BY HER  THE OTHER MOTIVE
WHY TO A PUBLIC COUNT I MIGHT NOT GO
IS THE GREAT LOVE THE GENERAL GENDER BEAR HIM
WHO DIPPING ALL HIS FAULTS IN THEIR AFFECTION
WOULD LIKE THE SPRING THAT TURNETH WOOD TO STONE
CONVERT HIS GYVES TO GRACES SO THAT MY ARROWS
TOO SLIGHTLY TIMBERD FOR SO LOUD A WIND
WOULD HAVE REVERTED TO MY BOW AGAIN
AND NOT WHERE I HAD AIMD THEM 
AND SO HAVE I A NOBLE FATHER LOST
A SISTER DRIVEN INTO DESPERATE TERMS
WHOSE WORTH IF PRAISES MAY GO BACK AGAIN
STOOD CHALLENGER ON MOUNT OF ALL THE AGE
FOR HER PERFECTIONS BUT MY REVENGE WILL COME 
BREAK NOT YOUR SLEEPS FOR THAT YOU MUST NOT THINK
THAT WE ARE MADE OF STUFF SO FLAT AND DULL
THAT WE CAN LET OUR BEARD BE SHOOK WITH DANGER
AND THINK IT PASTIME  YOU SHORTLY SHALL HEAR MORE
I LOVED YOUR FATHER AND WE LOVE OURSELF
AND THAT I HOPE WILL TEACH YOU TO IMAGINE 
HOW NOW  WHAT NEWS
LETTERS MY LORD FROM HAMLET
THIS TO YOUR MAJESTY THIS TO THE QUEEN 
FROM HAMLET  WHO BROUGHT THEM
SAILORS MY LORD THEY SAY I SAW THEM NOT
THEY WERE GIVEN ME BY CLAUDIO HE RECEIVED THEM
OF HIM THAT BROUGHT THEM 
LAERTES YOU SHALL HEAR THEM  LEAVE US 
HIGH AND MIGHTY YOU SHALL KNOW I AM SET NAKED ON
YOUR KINGDOM  TOMORROW SHALL I BEG LEAVE TO SEE
YOUR KINGLY EYES WHEN I SHALL FIRST ASKING YOUR
PARDON THEREUNTO RECOUNT THE OCCASION OF MY SUDDEN
AND MORE STRANGE RETURN                   HAMLET 
WHAT SHOULD THIS MEAN ARE ALL THE REST COME BACK
OR IS IT SOME ABUSE AND NO SUCH THING
KNOW YOU THE HAND
TIS HAMLETS CHARACTER  NAKED 
AND IN A POSTSCRIPT HERE HE SAYS ALONE 
CAN YOU ADVISE ME
IM LOST IN IT MY LORD  BUT LET HIM COME
IT WARMS THE VERY SICKNESS IN MY HEART
THAT I SHALL LIVE AND TELL HIM TO HIS TEETH
THUS DIDEST THOU 
IF IT BE SO LAERTES 
AS HOW SHOULD IT BE SO HOW OTHERWISE 
WILL YOU BE RULED BY ME
AY MY LORD
SO YOU WILL NOT OERRULE ME TO A PEACE 
TO THINE OWN PEACE  IF HE BE NOW RETURND
AS CHECKING AT HIS VOYAGE AND THAT HE MEANS
NO MORE TO UNDERTAKE IT I WILL WORK HIM
TO AN EXPLOIT NOW RIPE IN MY DEVICE
UNDER THE WHICH HE SHALL NOT CHOOSE BUT FALL
AND FOR HIS DEATH NO WIND OF BLAME SHALL BREATHE
BUT EVEN HIS MOTHER SHALL UNCHARGE THE PRACTISE
AND CALL IT ACCIDENT 
MY LORD I WILL BE RULED
THE RATHER IF YOU COULD DEVISE IT SO
THAT I MIGHT BE THE ORGAN 
IT FALLS RIGHT 
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKD OF SINCE YOUR TRAVEL MUCH
AND THAT IN HAMLETS HEARING FOR A QUALITY
WHEREIN THEY SAY YOU SHINE YOUR SUM OF PARTS
DID NOT TOGETHER PLUCK SUCH ENVY FROM HIM
AS DID THAT ONE AND THAT IN MY REGARD
OF THE UNWORTHIEST SIEGE 
WHAT PART IS THAT MY LORD
A VERY RIBAND IN THE CAP OF YOUTH
YET NEEDFUL TOO FOR YOUTH NO LESS BECOMES
THE LIGHT AND CARELESS LIVERY THAT IT WEARS
THAN SETTLED AGE HIS SABLES AND HIS WEEDS
IMPORTING HEALTH AND GRAVENESS  TWO MONTHS SINCE
HERE WAS A GENTLEMAN OF NORMANDY 
IVE SEEN MYSELF AND SERVED AGAINST THE FRENCH
AND THEY CAN WELL ON HORSEBACK BUT THIS GALLANT
HAD WITCHCRAFT INT HE GREW UNTO HIS SEAT
AND TO SUCH WONDROUS DOING BROUGHT HIS HORSE
AS HE HAD BEEN INCORPSED AND DEMINATURED
WITH THE BRAVE BEAST SO FAR HE TOPPD MY THOUGHT
THAT I IN FORGERY OF SHAPES AND TRICKS
COME SHORT OF WHAT HE DID 
A NORMAN WAST
A NORMAN 
UPON MY LIFE LAMOND 
THE VERY SAME 
I KNOW HIM WELL HE IS THE BROOCH INDEED
AND GEM OF ALL THE NATION 
HE MADE CONFESSION OF YOU
AND GAVE YOU SUCH A MASTERLY REPORT
FOR ART AND EXERCISE IN YOUR DEFENCE
AND FOR YOUR RAPIER MOST ESPECIALLY
THAT HE CRIED OUT TWOULD BE A SIGHT INDEED
IF ONE COULD MATCH YOU THE SCRIMERS OF THEIR NATION
HE SWORE HAD HAD NEITHER MOTION GUARD NOR EYE
IF YOU OPPOSED THEM  SIR THIS REPORT OF HIS
DID HAMLET SO ENVENOM WITH HIS ENVY
THAT HE COULD NOTHING DO BUT WISH AND BEG
YOUR SUDDEN COMING OER TO PLAY WITH HIM 
NOW OUT OF THIS 
WHAT OUT OF THIS MY LORD
LAERTES WAS YOUR FATHER DEAR TO YOU
OR ARE YOU LIKE THE PAINTING OF A SORROW
A FACE WITHOUT A HEART
WHY ASK YOU THIS
NOT THAT I THINK YOU DID NOT LOVE YOUR FATHER
BUT THAT I KNOW LOVE IS BEGUN BY TIME
AND THAT I SEE IN PASSAGES OF PROOF
TIME QUALIFIES THE SPARK AND FIRE OF IT 
THERE LIVES WITHIN THE VERY FLAME OF LOVE
A KIND OF WICK OR SNUFF THAT WILL ABATE IT
AND NOTHING IS AT A LIKE GOODNESS STILL
FOR GOODNESS GROWING TO A PLURISY
DIES IN HIS OWN TOO MUCH THAT WE WOULD DO
WE SHOULD DO WHEN WE WOULD FOR THIS WOULD CHANGES
AND HATH ABATEMENTS AND DELAYS AS MANY
AS THERE ARE TONGUES ARE HANDS ARE ACCIDENTS
AND THEN THIS SHOULD IS LIKE A SPENDTHRIFT SIGH
THAT HURTS BY EASING  BUT TO THE QUICK O THE ULCER 
HAMLET COMES BACK WHAT WOULD YOU UNDERTAKE
TO SHOW YOURSELF YOUR FATHERS SON IN DEED
MORE THAN IN WORDS
TO CUT HIS THROAT I THE CHURCH 
NO PLACE INDEED SHOULD MURDER SANCTUARIZE
REVENGE SHOULD HAVE NO BOUNDS  BUT GOOD LAERTES
WILL YOU DO THIS KEEP CLOSE WITHIN YOUR CHAMBER 
HAMLET RETURND SHALL KNOW YOU ARE COME HOME
WELL PUT ON THOSE SHALL PRAISE YOUR EXCELLENCE
AND SET A DOUBLE VARNISH ON THE FAME
THE FRENCHMAN GAVE YOU BRING YOU IN FINE TOGETHER
AND WAGER ON YOUR HEADS HE BEING REMISS
MOST GENEROUS AND FREE FROM ALL CONTRIVING
WILL NOT PERUSE THE FOILS SO THAT WITH EASE
OR WITH A LITTLE SHUFFLING YOU MAY CHOOSE
A SWORD UNBATED AND IN A PASS OF PRACTISE
REQUITE HIM FOR YOUR FATHER 
I WILL DOT
AND FOR THAT PURPOSE ILL ANOINT MY SWORD 
I BOUGHT AN UNCTION OF A MOUNTEBANK
SO MORTAL THAT BUT DIP A KNIFE IN IT
WHERE IT DRAWS BLOOD NO CATAPLASM SO RARE
COLLECTED FROM ALL SIMPLES THAT HAVE VIRTUE
UNDER THE MOON CAN SAVE THE THING FROM DEATH
THAT IS BUT SCRATCHD WITHAL ILL TOUCH MY POINT
WITH THIS CONTAGION THAT IF I GALL HIM SLIGHTLY
IT MAY BE DEATH 
LETS FURTHER THINK OF THIS
WEIGH WHAT CONVENIENCE BOTH OF TIME AND MEANS
MAY FIT US TO OUR SHAPE IF THIS SHOULD FAIL
AND THAT OUR DRIFT LOOK THROUGH OUR BAD PERFORMANCE
TWERE BETTER NOT ASSAYD THEREFORE THIS PROJECT
SHOULD HAVE A BACK OR SECOND THAT MIGHT HOLD
IF THIS SHOULD BLAST IN PROOF  SOFT  LET ME SEE
WELL MAKE A SOLEMN WAGER ON YOUR CUNNINGS I HAT 
WHEN IN YOUR MOTION YOU ARE HOT AND DRY 
AS MAKE YOUR BOUTS MORE VIOLENT TO THAT END 
AND THAT HE CALLS FOR DRINK ILL HAVE PREPARED HIM
A CHALICE FOR THE NONCE WHEREON BUT SIPPING
IF HE BY CHANCE ESCAPE YOUR VENOMD STUCK
OUR PURPOSE MAY HOLD THERE 
HOW NOW SWEET QUEEN 
ONE WOE DOTH TREAD UPON ANOTHERS HEEL
SO FAST THEY FOLLOW YOUR SISTERS DROWND LAERTES 
DROWND  O WHERE

BUT OUR COLD MAIDS DO DEAD MENS FINGERS CALL THEM
THERE ON THE PENDENT BOUGHS HER CORONET WEEDS
CLAMBERING TO HANG AN ENVIOUS SLIVER BROKE
WHEN DOWN HER WEEDY TROPHIES AND HERSELF
FELL IN THE WEEPING BROOK  HER CLOTHES SPREAD WIDE
AND MERMAIDLIKE AWHILE THEY BORE HER UP
WHICH TIME SHE CHANTED SNATCHES OF OLD TUNES
AS ONE INCAPABLE OF HER OWN DISTRESS
OR LIKE A CREATURE NATIVE AND INDUED

TILL THAT HER GARMENTS HEAVY WITH THEIR DRINK
PULLD THE POOR WRETCH FROM HER MELODIOUS LAY
