IN DELIVERING MY SON FROM ME I BURY A SECOND HUSBAND 
AND I IN GOING MADAM WEEP OER MY FATHERS DEATH
ANEW BUT I MUST ATTEND HIS MAJESTYS COMMAND TO
WHOM I AM NOW IN WARD EVERMORE IN SUBJECTION 
YOU SHALL FIND OF THE KING A HUSBAND MADAM YOU
SIR A FATHER HE THAT SO GENERALLY IS AT ALL TIMES
GOOD MUST OF NECESSITY HOLD HIS VIRTUE TO YOU WHOSE
WORTHINESS WOULD STIR IT UP WHERE IT WANTED RATHER
THAN LACK IT WHERE THERE IS SUCH ABUNDANCE 
WHAT HOPE IS THERE OF HIS MAJESTYS AMENDMENT
HE HATH ABANDONED HIS PHYSICIANS MADAM UNDER WHOSE
PRACTISES HE HATH PERSECUTED TIME WITH HOPE AND
FINDS NO OTHER ADVANTAGE IN THE PROCESS BUT ONLY THE
LOSING OF HOPE BY TIME 
THIS YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN HAD A FATHER O THAT
HAD  HOW SAD A PASSAGE TIS  WHOSE SKILL WAS
ALMOST AS GREAT AS HIS HONESTY HAD IT STRETCHED SO
FAR WOULD HAVE MADE NATURE IMMORTAL AND DEATH
SHOULD HAVE PLAY FOR LACK OF WORK  WOULD FOR THE
KINGS SAKE HE WERE LIVING  I THINK IT WOULD BE
THE DEATH OF THE KINGS DISEASE 
HOW CALLED YOU THE MAN YOU SPEAK OF MADAM
HE WAS FAMOUS SIR IN HIS PROFESSION AND IT WAS
HIS GREAT RIGHT TO BE SO GERARD DE NARBON 
HE WAS EXCELLENT INDEED MADAM THE KING VERY
LATELY SPOKE OF HIM ADMIRINGLY AND MOURNINGLY HE
WAS SKILFUL ENOUGH TO HAVE LIVED STILL IF KNOWLEDGE
COULD BE SET UP AGAINST MORTALITY 
WHAT IS IT MY GOOD LORD THE KING LANGUISHES OF
A FISTULA MY LORD 
I HEARD NOT OF IT BEFORE 
I WOULD IT WERE NOT NOTORIOUS  WAS THIS GENTLEWOMAN
THE DAUGHTER OF GERARD DE NARBON
HIS SOLE CHILD MY LORD AND BEQUEATHED TO MY
OVERLOOKING  I HAVE THOSE HOPES OF HER GOOD THAT
HER EDUCATION PROMISES HER DISPOSITIONS SHE
INHERITS WHICH MAKES FAIR GIFTS FAIRER FOR WHERE
AN UNCLEAN MIND CARRIES VIRTUOUS QUALITIES THERE
COMMENDATIONS GO WITH PITY THEY ARE VIRTUES AND
TRAITORS TOO IN HER THEY ARE THE BETTER FOR THEIR
SIMPLENESS SHE DERIVES HER HONESTY AND ACHIEVES HER GOODNESS 
YOUR COMMENDATIONS MADAM GET FROM HER TEARS 
TIS THE BEST BRINE A MAIDEN CAN SEASON HER PRAISE
IN  THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER FATHER NEVER APPROACHES
HER HEART BUT THE TYRANNY OF HER SORROWS TAKES ALL
LIVELIHOOD FROM HER CHEEK  NO MORE OF THIS HELENA
GO TO NO MORE LEST IT BE RATHER THOUGHT YOU AFFECT
A SORROW THAN HAVE IT 
I DO AFFECT A SORROW INDEED BUT I HAVE IT TOO 
MODERATE LAMENTATION IS THE RIGHT OF THE DEAD
EXCESSIVE GRIEF THE ENEMY TO THE LIVING 
IF THE LIVING BE ENEMY TO THE GRIEF THE EXCESS
MAKES IT SOON MORTAL 
MADAM I DESIRE YOUR HOLY WISHES 
HOW UNDERSTAND WE THAT
BE THOU BLEST BERTRAM AND SUCCEED THY FATHER
IN MANNERS AS IN SHAPE  THY BLOOD AND VIRTUE
CONTEND FOR EMPIRE IN THEE AND THY GOODNESS
SHARE WITH THY BIRTHRIGHT  LOVE ALL TRUST A FEW
DO WRONG TO NONE BE ABLE FOR THINE ENEMY
RATHER IN POWER THAN USE AND KEEP THY FRIEND
UNDER THY OWN LIFES KEY BE CHEQUED FOR SILENCE
BUT NEVER TAXD FOR SPEECH  WHAT HEAVEN MORE WILL
THAT THEE MAY FURNISH AND MY PRAYERS PLUCK DOWN
FALL ON THY HEAD  FAREWELL MY LORD
TIS AN UNSEASOND COURTIER GOOD MY LORD
ADVISE HIM 
HE CANNOT WANT THE BEST
THAT SHALL ATTEND HIS LOVE 
HEAVEN BLESS HIM  FAREWELL BERTRAM 
  THE BEST WISHES THAT CAN BE FORGED IN
YOUR THOUGHTS BE SERVANTS TO YOU  BE COMFORTABLE
TO MY MOTHER YOUR MISTRESS AND MAKE MUCH OF HER 
FAREWELL PRETTY LADY YOU MUST HOLD THE CREDIT OF
YOUR FATHER 
O WERE THAT ALL  I THINK NOT ON MY FATHER
AND THESE GREAT TEARS GRACE HIS REMEMBRANCE MORE
THAN THOSE I SHED FOR HIM  WHAT WAS HE LIKE
I HAVE FORGOT HIM MY IMAGINATION
CARRIES NO FAVOUR INT BUT BERTRAMS 
I AM UNDONE THERE IS NO LIVING NONE
IF BERTRAM BE AWAY  TWERE ALL ONE
THAT I SHOULD LOVE A BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR
AND THINK TO WED IT HE IS SO ABOVE ME
IN HIS BRIGHT RADIANCE AND COLLATERAL LIGHT
MUST I BE COMFORTED NOT IN HIS SPHERE 
THE AMBITION IN MY LOVE THUS PLAGUES ITSELF
THE HIND THAT WOULD BE MATED BY THE LION
MUST DIE FOR LOVE  TWAS PRETTY THOUGH PLAGUE
TO SEE HIM EVERY HOUR TO SIT AND DRAW
HIS ARCHED BROWS HIS HAWKING EYE HIS CURLS
IN OUR HEARTS TABLE HEART TOO CAPABLE
OF EVERY LINE AND TRICK OF HIS SWEET FAVOUR
BUT NOW HES GONE AND MY IDOLATROUS FANCY
MUST SANCTIFY HIS RELIQUES  WHO COMES HERE
ONE THAT GOES WITH HIM I LOVE HIM FOR HIS SAKE
AND YET I KNOW HIM A NOTORIOUS LIAR
THINK HIM A GREAT WAY FOOL SOLELY A COWARD
YET THESE FIXED EVILS SIT SO FIT IN HIM
THAT THEY TAKE PLACE WHEN VIRTUES STEELY BONES
LOOK BLEAK I THE COLD WIND WITHAL FULL OFT WE SEE
COLD WISDOM WAITING ON SUPERFLUOUS FOLLY 
SAVE YOU FAIR QUEEN 
AND YOU MONARCH 
NO 
AND NO 
ARE YOU MEDITATING ON VIRGINITY
AY  YOU HAVE SOME STAIN OF SOLDIER IN YOU LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION  MAN IS ENEMY TO VIRGINITY HOW
MAY WE BARRICADO IT AGAINST HIM
KEEP HIM OUT 
BUT HE ASSAILS AND OUR VIRGINITY THOUGH VALIANT
IN THE DEFENCE YET IS WEAK UNFOLD TO US SOME
WARLIKE RESISTANCE 
THERE IS NONE MAN SITTING DOWN BEFORE YOU WILL
UNDERMINE YOU AND BLOW YOU UP 
BLESS OUR POOR VIRGINITY FROM UNDERMINERS AND
BLOWERS UP  IS THERE NO MILITARY POLICY HOW
VIRGINS MIGHT BLOW UP MEN
VIRGINITY BEING BLOWN DOWN MAN WILL QUICKLIER BE
BLOWN UP MARRY IN BLOWING HIM DOWN AGAIN WITH
THE BREACH YOURSELVES MADE YOU LOSE YOUR CITY  IT
IS NOT POLITIC IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATURE TO
PRESERVE VIRGINITY  LOSS OF VIRGINITY IS RATIONAL
INCREASE AND THERE WAS NEVER VIRGIN GOT TILL
VIRGINITY WAS FIRST LOST  THAT YOU WERE MADE OF IS
METAL TO MAKE VIRGINS  VIRGINITY BY BEING ONCE LOST
MAY BE TEN TIMES FOUND BY BEING EVER KEPT IT IS
EVER LOST TIS TOO COLD A COMPANION AWAY WITH T 
I WILL STAND FOR T A LITTLE THOUGH THEREFORE I DIE A VIRGIN 
THERES LITTLE CAN BE SAID IN T TIS AGAINST THE
RULE OF NATURE  TO SPEAK ON THE PART OF VIRGINITY
IS TO ACCUSE YOUR MOTHERS WHICH IS MOST INFALLIBLE
DISOBEDIENCE  HE THAT HANGS HIMSELF IS A VIRGIN
VIRGINITY MURDERS ITSELF AND SHOULD BE BURIED IN
HIGHWAYS OUT OF ALL SANCTIFIED LIMIT AS A DESPERATE
OFFENDRESS AGAINST NATURE  VIRGINITY BREEDS MITES
MUCH LIKE A CHEESE CONSUMES ITSELF TO THE VERY
PARING AND SO DIES WITH FEEDING HIS OWN STOMACH 
BESIDES VIRGINITY IS PEEVISH PROUD IDLE MADE OF
SELFLOVE WHICH IS THE MOST INHIBITED SIN IN THE
CANON  KEEP IT NOT YOU CANNOT CHOOSE BUT LOOSE
BYT OUT WITH T  WITHIN TEN YEAR IT WILL MAKE
ITSELF TEN WHICH IS A GOODLY INCREASE AND THE
PRINCIPAL ITSELF NOT MUCH THE WORSE AWAY WITH T 
HOW MIGHT ONE DO SIR TO LOSE IT TO HER OWN LIKING
LET ME SEE MARRY ILL TO LIKE HIM THAT NEER IT
LIKES  TIS A COMMODITY WILL LOSE THE GLOSS WITH
LYING THE LONGER KEPT THE LESS WORTH OFF WITH T
WHILE TIS VENDIBLE ANSWER THE TIME OF REQUEST 
VIRGINITY LIKE AN OLD COURTIER WEARS HER CAP OUT
OF FASHION RICHLY SUITED BUT UNSUITABLE JUST
LIKE THE BROOCH AND THE TOOTHPICK WHICH WEAR NOT
NOW  YOUR DATE IS BETTER IN YOUR PIE AND YOUR
PORRIDGE THAN IN YOUR CHEEK AND YOUR VIRGINITY
YOUR OLD VIRGINITY IS LIKE ONE OF OUR FRENCH
WITHERED PEARS IT LOOKS ILL IT EATS DRILY MARRY
TIS A WITHERED PEAR IT WAS FORMERLY BETTER
MARRY YET TIS A WITHERED PEAR WILL YOU ANYTHING WITH IT
NOT MY VIRGINITY YET
THERE SHALL YOUR MASTER HAVE A THOUSAND LOVES
A MOTHER AND A MISTRESS AND A FRIEND
A PHOENIX CAPTAIN AND AN ENEMY
A GUIDE A GODDESS AND A SOVEREIGN
A COUNSELLOR A TRAITRESS AND A DEAR
HIS HUMBLE AMBITION PROUD HUMILITY
HIS JARRING CONCORD AND HIS DISCORD DULCET
HIS FAITH HIS SWEET DISASTER WITH A WORLD
OF PRETTY FOND ADOPTIOUS CHRISTENDOMS
THAT BLINKING CUPID GOSSIPS  NOW SHALL HE 
I KNOW NOT WHAT HE SHALL  GOD SEND HIM WELL 
THE COURTS A LEARNING PLACE AND HE IS ONE 
WHAT ONE I FAITH
THAT I WISH WELL  TIS PITY 
WHATS PITY
THAT WISHING WELL HAD NOT A BODY INT
WHICH MIGHT BE FELT THAT WE THE POORER BORN
WHOSE BASER STARS DO SHUT US UP IN WISHES

READING IT HE CHANGED ALMOST INTO ANOTHER MAN 
HE HAS MUCH WORTHY BLAME LAID UPON HIM FOR SHAKING
OFF SO GOOD A WIFE AND SO SWEET A LADY 
ESPECIALLY HE HATH INCURRED THE EVERLASTING
DISPLEASURE OF THE KING WHO HAD EVEN TUNED HIS
BOUNTY TO SING HAPPINESS TO HIM  I WILL TELL YOU A
THING BUT YOU SHALL LET IT DWELL DARKLY WITH YOU 
WHEN YOU HAVE SPOKEN IT TIS DEAD AND I AM THE
GRAVE OF IT 
HE HATH PERVERTED A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN HERE IN
FLORENCE OF A MOST CHASTE RENOWN AND THIS NIGHT HE
FLESHES HIS WILL IN THE SPOIL OF HER HONOUR HE HATH
GIVEN HER HIS MONUMENTAL RING AND THINKS HIMSELF
MADE IN THE UNCHASTE COMPOSITION 
NOW GOD DELAY OUR REBELLION  AS WE ARE OURSELVES
WHAT THINGS ARE WE 
MERELY OUR OWN TRAITORS  AND AS IN THE COMMON COURSE
OF ALL TREASONS WE STILL SEE THEM REVEAL
THEMSELVES TILL THEY ATTAIN TO THEIR ABHORRED ENDS
SO HE THAT IN THIS ACTION CONTRIVES AGAINST HIS OWN
NOBILITY IN HIS PROPER STREAM OERFLOWS HIMSELF 
IS IT NOT MEANT DAMNABLE IN US TO BE TRUMPETERS OF
OUR UNLAWFUL INTENTS WE SHALL NOT THEN HAVE HIS
COMPANY TONIGHT
NOT TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT FOR HE IS DIETED TO HIS HOUR 
THAT APPROACHES APACE I WOULD GLADLY HAVE HIM SEE
HIS COMPANY ANATOMIZED THAT HE MIGHT TAKE A MEASURE
OF HIS OWN JUDGMENTS WHEREIN SO CURIOUSLY HE HAD
SET THIS COUNTERFEIT 
WE WILL NOT MEDDLE WITH HIM TILL HE COME FOR HIS
PRESENCE MUST BE THE WHIP OF THE OTHER 
IN THE MEAN TIME WHAT HEAR YOU OF THESE WARS
I HEAR THERE IS AN OVERTURE OF PEACE 
NAY I ASSURE YOU A PEACE CONCLUDED 
WHAT WILL COUNT ROUSILLON DO THEN WILL HE TRAVEL
HIGHER OR RETURN AGAIN INTO FRANCE

OF HIS ACT 
SIR HIS WIFE SOME TWO MONTHS SINCE FLED FROM HIS
HOUSE HER PRETENCE IS A PILGRIMAGE TO SAINT JAQUES
LE GRAND WHICH HOLY UNDERTAKING WITH MOST AUSTERE
SANCTIMONY SHE ACCOMPLISHED AND THERE RESIDING THE
TENDERNESS OF HER NATURE BECAME AS A PREY TO HER
GRIEF IN FINE MADE A GROAN OF HER LAST BREATH AND
NOW SHE SINGS IN HEAVEN 
HOW IS THIS JUSTIFIED
THE STRONGER PART OF IT BY HER OWN LETTERS WHICH
MAKES HER STORY TRUE EVEN TO THE POINT OF HER
DEATH HER DEATH ITSELF WHICH COULD NOT BE HER

WITH A SHAME AS AMPLE

AND EVERY HAIR THATS ONT HELEN THATS DEAD
WAS A SWEET CREATURE SUCH A RING AS THIS
THE LAST THAT EER I TOOK HER AT COURT

WRAPPD IN A PAPER WHICH CONTAIND THE NAME
OF HER THAT THREW IT NOBLE SHE WAS AND THOUGHT
I STOOD ENGAGED BUT WHEN I HAD SUBSCRIBED
TO MINE OWN FORTUNE AND INFORMD HER FULLY
I COULD NOT ANSWER IN THAT COURSE OF HONOUR
AS SHE HAD MADE THE OVERTURE SHE CEASED
IN HEAVY SATISFACTION AND WOULD NEVER
RECEIVE THE RING AGAIN 
PLUTUS HIMSELF

HATH NOT IN NATURES MYSTERY MORE SCIENCE

THAT SHE WOULD NEVER PUT IT FROM HER FINGER
UNLESS SHE GAVE IT TO YOURSELF IN BED
WHERE YOU HAVE NEVER COME OR SENT IT US
UPON HER GREAT DISASTER 
SHE NEVER SAW IT 
THOU SPEAKST IT FALSELY AS I LOVE MINE HONOUR
AND MAKEST CONJECTURAL FEARS TO COME INTO ME
WHICH I WOULD FAIN SHUT OUT  IF IT SHOULD PROVE
THAT THOU ART SO INHUMAN TWILL NOT PROVE SO 
AND YET I KNOW NOT THOU DIDST HATE HER DEADLY
AND SHE IS DEAD WHICH NOTHING BUT TO CLOSE
HER EYES MYSELF COULD WIN ME TO BELIEVE
MORE THAN TO SEE THIS RING  TAKE HIM AWAY 
MY FOREPAST PROOFS HOWEER THE MATTER FALL

HAVING VAINLY FEARD TOO LITTLE  AWAY WITH HIM 
WELL SIFT THIS MATTER FURTHER 
IF YOU SHALL PROVE
THIS RING WAS EVER HERS YOU SHALL AS EASY
PROVE THAT I HUSBANDED HER BED IN FLORENCE
WHERE YET SHE NEVER WAS

GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN

HERES A PETITION FROM A FLORENTINE
WHO HATH FOR FOUR OR FIVE REMOVES COME SHORT
TO TENDER IT HERSELF  I UNDERTOOK IT
VANQUISHD THERETO BY THE FAIR GRACE AND SPEECH
OF THE POOR SUPPLIANT WHO BY THIS I KNOW
IS HERE ATTENDING HER BUSINESS LOOKS IN HER
WITH AN IMPORTING VISAGE AND SHE TOLD ME
IN A SWEET VERBAL BRIEF IT DID CONCERN
