HUNG BE THE HEAVENS WITH BLACK YIELD DAY TO NIGHT 
COMETS IMPORTING CHANGE OF TIMES AND STATES
BRANDISH YOUR CRYSTAL TRESSES IN THE SKY
AND WITH THEM SCOURGE THE BAD REVOLTING STARS
THAT HAVE CONSENTED UNTO HENRYS DEATH 
KING HENRY THE FIFTH TOO FAMOUS TO LIVE LONG 
ENGLAND NEER LOST A KING OF SO MUCH WORTH 
ENGLAND NEER HAD A KING UNTIL HIS TIME 
VIRTUE HE HAD DESERVING TO COMMAND
HIS BRANDISHD SWORD DID BLIND MEN WITH HIS BEAMS
HIS ARMS SPREAD WIDER THAN A DRAGONS WINGS
HIS SPARKING EYES REPLETE WITH WRATHFUL FIRE
MORE DAZZLED AND DROVE BACK HIS ENEMIES
THAN MIDDAY SUN FIERCE BENT AGAINST THEIR FACES 
WHAT SHOULD I SAY HIS DEEDS EXCEED ALL SPEECH
HE NEER LIFT UP HIS HAND BUT CONQUERED 
WE MOURN IN BLACK WHY MOURN WE NOT IN BLOOD
HENRY IS DEAD AND NEVER SHALL REVIVE
UPON A WOODEN COFFIN WE ATTEND
AND DEATHS DISHONOURABLE VICTORY
WE WITH OUR STATELY PRESENCE GLORIFY
LIKE CAPTIVES BOUND TO A TRIUMPHANT CAR 
WHAT  SHALL WE CURSE THE PLANETS OF MISHAP
THAT PLOTTED THUS OUR GLORYS OVERTHROW
OR SHALL WE THINK THE SUBTLEWITTED FRENCH
CONJURERS AND SORCERERS THAT AFRAID OF HIM
BY MAGIC VERSES HAVE CONTRIVED HIS END
HE WAS A KING BLESSD OF THE KING OF KINGS 
UNTO THE FRENCH THE DREADFUL JUDGEMENTDAY
SO DREADFUL WILL NOT BE AS WAS HIS SIGHT 
THE BATTLES OF THE LORD OF HOSTS HE FOUGHT
THE CHURCHS PRAYERS MADE HIM SO PROSPEROUS 
THE CHURCH  WHERE IS IT HAD NOT CHURCHMEN PRAYD
HIS THREAD OF LIFE HAD NOT SO SOON DECAYD
NONE DO YOU LIKE BUT AN EFFEMINATE PRINCE
WHOM LIKE A SCHOOLBOY YOU MAY OVERAWE 
GLOUCESTER WHATEER WE LIKE THOU ART PROTECTOR
AND LOOKEST TO COMMAND THE PRINCE AND REALM 
THY WIFE IS PROUD SHE HOLDETH THEE IN AWE
MORE THAN GOD OR RELIGIOUS CHURCHMEN MAY 
NAME NOT RELIGION FOR THOU LOVEST THE FLESH
AND NEER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO CHURCH THOU GOST
EXCEPT IT BE TO PRAY AGAINST THY FOES 
CEASE CEASE THESE JARS AND REST YOUR MINDS IN PEACE
LETS TO THE ALTAR HERALDS WAIT ON US
INSTEAD OF GOLD WELL OFFER UP OUR ARMS
SINCE ARMS AVAIL NOT NOW THAT HENRYS DEAD 
POSTERITY AWAIT FOR WRETCHED YEARS
WHEN AT THEIR MOTHERS MOIST EYES BABES SHALL SUCK
OUR ISLE BE MADE A NOURISH OF SALT TEARS
AND NONE BUT WOMEN LEFT TO WAIL THE DEAD 
HENRY THE FIFTH THY GHOST I INVOCATE
PROSPER THIS REALM KEEP IT FROM CIVIL BROILS
COMBAT WITH ADVERSE PLANETS IN THE HEAVENS 
A FAR MORE GLORIOUS STAR THY SOUL WILL MAKE
THAN JULIUS CAESAR OR BRIGHT 
MY HONOURABLE LORDS HEALTH TO YOU ALL 
SAD TIDINGS BRING I TO YOU OUT OF FRANCE
OF LOSS OF SLAUGHTER AND DISCOMFITURE
GUIENNE CHAMPAGNE RHEIMS ORLEANS
PARIS GUYSORS POICTIERS ARE ALL QUITE LOST 
WHAT SAYST THOU MAN BEFORE DEAD HENRYS CORSE
SPEAK SOFTLY OR THE LOSS OF THOSE GREAT TOWNS
WILL MAKE HIM BURST HIS LEAD AND RISE FROM DEATH 
IS PARIS LOST IS ROUEN YIELDED UP
IF HENRY WERE RECALLD TO LIFE AGAIN
THESE NEWS WOULD CAUSE HIM ONCE MORE YIELD THE GHOST 
HOW WERE THEY LOST WHAT TREACHERY WAS USED
NO TREACHERY BUT WANT OF MEN AND MONEY 
AMONGST THE SOLDIERS THIS IS MUTTERED
THAT HERE YOU MAINTAIN SEVERAL FACTIONS
AND WHILST A FIELD SHOULD BE DISPATCHD AND FOUGHT
YOU ARE DISPUTING OF YOUR GENERALS
ONE WOULD HAVE LINGERING WARS WITH LITTLE COST
ANOTHER WOULD FLY SWIFT BUT WANTETH WINGS
A THIRD THINKS WITHOUT EXPENSE AT ALL
BY GUILEFUL FAIR WORDS PEACE MAY BE OBTAIND 
AWAKE AWAKE ENGLISH NOBILITY 
LET NOT SLOTH DIM YOUR HORRORS NEWBEGOT
CROPPD ARE THE FLOWERDELUCES IN YOUR ARMS
OF ENGLANDS COAT ONE HALF IS CUT AWAY 
WERE OUR TEARS WANTING TO THIS FUNERAL
THESE TIDINGS WOULD CALL FORTH THEIR FLOWING TIDES 
ME THEY CONCERN REGENT I AM OF FRANCE 
GIVE ME MY STEELED COAT  ILL FIGHT FOR FRANCE 
AWAY WITH THESE DISGRACEFUL WAILING ROBES 
WOUNDS WILL I LEND THE FRENCH INSTEAD OF EYES
TO WEEP THEIR INTERMISSIVE MISERIES 
LORDS VIEW THESE LETTERS FULL OF BAD MISCHANCE 
FRANCE IS REVOLTED FROM THE ENGLISH QUITE
EXCEPT SOME PETTY TOWNS OF NO IMPORT
THE DAUPHIN CHARLES IS CROWNED KING OF RHEIMS
THE BASTARD OF ORLEANS WITH HIM IS JOIND
REIGNIER DUKE OF ANJOU DOTH TAKE HIS PART
THE DUKE OF ALENCON FLIETH TO HIS SIDE 
THE DAUPHIN CROWNED KING  ALL FLY TO HIM 
O WHITHER SHALL WE FLY FROM THIS REPROACH
WE WILL NOT FLY BUT TO OUR ENEMIES THROATS 
BEDFORD IF THOU BE SLACK ILL FIGHT IT OUT 
GLOUCESTER WHY DOUBTST THOU OF MY FORWARDNESS
AN ARMY HAVE I MUSTERD IN MY THOUGHTS
WHEREWITH ALREADY FRANCE IS OVERRUN 
MY GRACIOUS LORDS TO ADD TO YOUR LAMENTS
WHEREWITH YOU NOW BEDEW KING HENRYS HEARSE
I MUST INFORM YOU OF A DISMAL FIGHT
BETWIXT THE STOUT LORD TALBOT AND THE FRENCH 
WHAT  WHEREIN TALBOT OVERCAME IST SO
O NO WHEREIN LORD TALBOT WAS OERTHROWN
THE CIRCUMSTANCE ILL TELL YOU MORE AT LARGE 
THE TENTH OF AUGUST LAST THIS DREADFUL LORD
RETIRING FROM THE SIEGE OF ORLEANS
HAVING FULL SCARCE SIX THOUSAND IN HIS TROOP 
BY THREE AND TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE FRENCH
WAS ROUND ENCOMPASSED AND SET UPON 
NO LEISURE HAD HE TO ENRANK HIS MEN
HE WANTED PIKES TO SET BEFORE HIS ARCHERS
INSTEAD WHEREOF SHARP STAKES PLUCKD OUT OF HEDGES
THEY PITCHED IN THE GROUND CONFUSEDLY
TO KEEP THE HORSEMEN OFF FROM BREAKING IN 
MORE THAN THREE HOURS THE FIGHT CONTINUED
WHERE VALIANT TALBOT ABOVE HUMAN THOUGHT
ENACTED WONDERS WITH HIS SWORD AND LANCE
HUNDREDS HE SENT TO HELL AND NONE DURST STAND HIM
HERE THERE AND EVERY WHERE ENRAGED HE FLEW
THE FRENCH EXCLAIMD THE DEVIL WAS IN ARMS
ALL THE WHOLE ARMY STOOD AGAZED ON HIM
HIS SOLDIERS SPYING HIS UNDAUNTED SPIRIT
A TALBOT  A TALBOT  CRIED OUT AMAIN
AND RUSHD INTO THE BOWELS OF THE BATTLE 
HERE HAD THE CONQUEST FULLY BEEN SEALD UP
IF SIR JOHN FASTOLFE HAD NOT PLAYD THE COWARD
HE BEING IN THE VAWARD PLACED BEHIND
WITH PURPOSE TO RELIEVE AND FOLLOW THEM
COWARDLY FLED NOT HAVING STRUCK ONE STROKE 
HENCE GREW THE GENERAL WRECK AND MASSACRE
ENCLOSED WERE THEY WITH THEIR ENEMIES
A BASE WALLOON TO WIN THE DAUPHINS GRACE
THRUST TALBOT WITH A SPEAR INTO THE BACK
WHOM ALL FRANCE WITH THEIR CHIEF ASSEMBLED STRENGTH
DURST NOT PRESUME TO LOOK ONCE IN THE FACE 
IS TALBOT SLAIN THEN I WILL SLAY MYSELF
FOR LIVING IDLY HERE IN POMP AND EASE
WHILST SUCH A WORTHY LEADER WANTING AID
UNTO HIS DASTARD FOEMEN IS BETRAYD 
O NO HE LIVES BUT IS TOOK PRISONER
AND LORD SCALES WITH HIM AND LORD HUNGERFORD
MOST OF THE REST SLAUGHTERD OR TOOK LIKEWISE 
HIS RANSOM THERE IS NONE BUT I SHALL PAY
ILL HALE THE DAUPHIN HEADLONG FROM HIS THRONE
HIS CROWN SHALL BE THE RANSOM OF MY FRIEND
FOUR OF THEIR LORDS ILL CHANGE FOR ONE OF OURS 
FAREWELL MY MASTERS TO MY TASK WILL I
BONFIRES IN FRANCE FORTHWITH I AM TO MAKE
TO KEEP OUR GREAT SAINT GEORGES FEAST WITHAL
TEN THOUSAND SOLDIERS WITH ME I WILL TAKE
WHOSE BLOODY DEEDS SHALL MAKE ALL EUROPE QUAKE 
SO YOU HAD NEED FOR ORLEANS IS BESIEGED
THE ENGLISH ARMY IS GROWN WEAK AND FAINT
THE EARL OF SALISBURY CRAVETH SUPPLY
AND HARDLY KEEPS HIS MEN FROM MUTINY
SINCE THEY SO FEW WATCH SUCH A MULTITUDE 
REMEMBER LORDS YOUR OATHS TO HENRY SWORN
EITHER TO QUELL THE DAUPHIN UTTERLY
OR BRING HIM IN OBEDIENCE TO YOUR YOKE 
I DO REMEMBER IT AND HERE TAKE MY LEAVE
TO GO ABOUT MY PREPARATION 
ILL TO THE TOWER WITH ALL THE HASTE I CAN
TO VIEW THE ARTILLERY AND MUNITION
AND THEN I WILL PROCLAIM YOUNG HENRY KING 
TO ELTHAM WILL I WHERE THE YOUNG KING IS
BEING ORDAIND HIS SPECIAL GOVERNOR
AND FOR HIS SAFETY THERE ILL BEST DEVISE 
EACH HATH HIS PLACE AND FUNCTION TO ATTEND
I AM LEFT OUT FOR ME NOTHING REMAINS 
BUT LONG I WILL NOT BE JACK OUT OF OFFICE
THE KING FROM ELTHAM I INTEND TO STEAL
AND SIT AT CHIEFEST STERN OF PUBLIC WEAL 
MARS HIS TRUE MOVING EVEN AS IN THE HEAVENS
SO IN THE EARTH TO THIS DAY IS NOT KNOWN
LATE DID HE SHINE UPON THE ENGLISH SIDE
NOW WE ARE VICTORS UPON US HE SMILES 
WHAT TOWNS OF ANY MOMENT BUT WE HAVE
AT PLEASURE HERE WE LIE NEAR ORLEANS
OTHERWHILES THE FAMISHD ENGLISH LIKE PALE GHOSTS
FAINTLY BESIEGE US ONE HOUR IN A MONTH 
THEY WANT THEIR PORRIDGE AND THEIR FAT BULLBEEVES
EITHER THEY MUST BE DIETED LIKE MULES
AND HAVE THEIR PROVENDER TIED TO THEIR MOUTHS
OR PITEOUS THEY WILL LOOK LIKE DROWNED MICE 
LETS RAISE THE SIEGE WHY LIVE WE IDLY HERE
TALBOT IS TAKEN WHOM WE WONT TO FEAR
REMAINETH NONE BUT MADBRAIND SALISBURY
AND HE MAY WELL IN FRETTING SPEND HIS GALL
NOR MEN NOR MONEY HATH HE TO MAKE WAR 
SOUND SOUND ALARUM  WE WILL RUSH ON THEM 
NOW FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FORLORN FRENCH 
HIM I FORGIVE MY DEATH THAT KILLETH ME
WHEN HE SEES ME GO BACK ONE FOOT OR FLY 
WHO EVER SAW THE LIKE WHAT MEN HAVE I 
DOGS  COWARDS  DASTARDS  I WOULD NEER HAVE FLED
BUT THAT THEY LEFT ME MIDST MY ENEMIES 
SALISBURY IS A DESPERATE HOMICIDE
HE FIGHTETH AS ONE WEARY OF HIS LIFE 
THE OTHER LORDS LIKE LIONS WANTING FOOD
DO RUSH UPON US AS THEIR HUNGRY PREY 
FROISSART A COUNTRYMAN OF OURS RECORDS
ENGLAND ALL OLIVERS AND ROWLANDS BRED
DURING THE TIME EDWARD THE THIRD DID REIGN 
MORE TRULY NOW MAY THIS BE VERIFIED
FOR NONE BUT SAMSONS AND GOLIASES
IT SENDETH FORTH TO SKIRMISH  ONE TO TEN 
LEAN RAWBONED RASCALS  WHO WOULD EER SUPPOSE
THEY HAD SUCH COURAGE AND AUDACITY
LETS LEAVE THIS TOWN FOR THEY ARE HAREBRAIND SLAVES
AND HUNGER WILL ENFORCE THEM TO BE MORE EAGER
OF OLD I KNOW THEM RATHER WITH THEIR TEETH
THE WALLS THEYLL TEAR DOWN THAN FORSAKE THE SIEGE 
I THINK BY SOME ODD GIMMORS OR DEVICE
THEIR ARMS ARE SET LIKE CLOCKS STIFF TO STRIKE ON
ELSE NEER COULD THEY HOLD OUT SO AS THEY DO 
BY MY CONSENT WELL EVEN LET THEM ALONE 
BE IT SO 
WHERES THE PRINCE DAUPHIN I HAVE NEWS FOR HIM 
BASTARD OF ORLEANS THRICE WELCOME TO US

IN IRON WALLS THEY DEEMD ME NOT SECURE
SO GREAT FEAR OF MY NAME MONGST THEM WAS SPREAD
THAT THEY SUPPOSED I COULD REND BARS OF STEEL
AND SPURN IN PIECES POSTS OF ADAMANT
WHEREFORE A GUARD OF CHOSEN SHOT I HAD
THAT WALKED ABOUT ME EVERY MINUTEWHILE
AND IF I DID BUT STIR OUT OF MY BED
READY THEY WERE TO SHOOT ME TO THE HEART 
I GRIEVE TO HEAR WHAT TORMENTS YOU ENDURED

CONTRIVED BY ART AND BALEFUL SORCERY 
COWARD OF FRANCE  HOW MUCH HE WRONGS HIS FAME
DESPAIRING OF HIS OWN ARMS FORTITUDE
TO JOIN WITH WITCHES AND THE HELP OF HELL 
TRAITORS HAVE NEVER OTHER COMPANY 
BUT WHATS THAT PUCELLE WHOM THEY TERM SO PURE
A MAID THEY SAY 
A MAID  AND BE SO MARTIAL 
PRAY GOD SHE PROVE NOT MASCULINE ERE LONG
IF UNDERNEATH THE STANDARD OF THE FRENCH
SHE CARRY ARMOUR AS SHE HATH BEGUN 
WELL LET THEM PRACTISE AND CONVERSE WITH SPIRITS
GOD IS OUR FORTRESS IN WHOSE CONQUERING NAME
LET US RESOLVE TO SCALE THEIR FLINTY BULWARKS 
ASCEND BRAVE TALBOT WE WILL FOLLOW THEE 
NOT ALL TOGETHER BETTER FAR I GUESS
THAT WE DO MAKE OUR ENTRANCE SEVERAL WAYS
THAT IF IT CHANCE THE ONE OF US DO FAIL
THE OTHER YET MAY RISE AGAINST THEIR FORCE 
AGREED ILL TO YOND CORNER 
AND I TO THIS 
AND HERE WILL TALBOT MOUNT OR MAKE HIS GRAVE 
NOW SALISBURY FOR THEE AND FOR THE RIGHT
OF ENGLISH HENRY SHALL THIS NIGHT APPEAR
HOW MUCH IN DUTY I AM BOUND TO BOTH 
ARM  ARM  THE ENEMY DOTH MAKE ASSAULT 
HOW NOW MY LORDS  WHAT ALL UNREADY SO
UNREADY  AY AND GLAD WE SCAPED SO WELL 
TWAS TIME I TROW TO WAKE AND LEAVE OUR BEDS
HEARING ALARUMS AT OUR CHAMBERDOORS 
OF ALL EXPLOITS SINCE FIRST I FOLLOWD ARMS
NEER HEARD I OF A WARLIKE ENTERPRISE
MORE VENTUROUS OR DESPERATE THAN THIS 
I THINK THIS TALBOT BE A FIEND OF HELL 
IF NOT OF HELL THE HEAVENS SURE FAVOUR HIM 
HERE COMETH CHARLES I MARVEL HOW HE SPED 
TUT HOLY JOAN WAS HIS DEFENSIVE GUARD 
IS THIS THY CUNNING THOU DECEITFUL DAME
DIDST THOU AT FIRST TO FLATTER US WITHAL
MAKE US PARTAKERS OF A LITTLE GAIN
THAT NOW OUR LOSS MIGHT BE TEN TIMES SO MUCH
WHEREFORE IS CHARLES IMPATIENT WITH HIS FRIEND 
AT ALL TIMES WILL YOU HAVE MY POWER ALIKE
SLEEPING OR WAKING MUST I STILL PREVAIL
OR WILL YOU BLAME AND LAY THE FAULT ON ME
IMPROVIDENT SOLDIERS  HAD YOUR WATCH BEEN GOOD
THIS SUDDEN MISCHIEF NEVER COULD HAVE FALLN 
DUKE OF ALENCON THIS WAS YOUR DEFAULT
THAT BEING CAPTAIN OF THE WATCH TONIGHT
DID LOOK NO BETTER TO THAT WEIGHTY CHARGE 
HAD ALL YOUR QUARTERS BEEN AS SAFELY KEPT
AS THAT WHEREOF I HAD THE GOVERNMENT
WE HAD NOT BEEN THUS SHAMEFULLY SURPRISED 
MINE WAS SECURE 
AND SO WAS MINE MY LORD 
AND FOR MYSELF MOST PART OF ALL THIS NIGHT
WITHIN HER QUARTER AND MINE OWN PRECINCT
I WAS EMPLOYD IN PASSING TO AND FRO
ABOUT RELIEVING OF THE SENTINELS
THEN HOW OR WHICH WAY SHOULD THEY FIRST BREAK IN
QUESTION MY LORDS NO FURTHER OF THE CASE
HOW OR WHICH WAY TIS SURE THEY FOUND SOME PLACE
BUT WEAKLY GUARDED WHERE THE BREACH WAS MADE 
AND NOW THERE RESTS NO OTHER SHIFT BUT THIS
TO GATHER OUR SOLDIERS SCATTERD AND DISPERSED
AND LAY NEW PLATFORMS TO ENDAMAGE THEM 
ILL BE SO BOLD TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE LEFT 
THE CRY OF TALBOT SERVES ME FOR A SWORD
FOR I HAVE LOADEN ME WITH MANY SPOILS
USING NO OTHER WEAPON BUT HIS NAME 
THE DAY BEGINS TO BREAK AND NIGHT IS FLED
WHOSE PITCHY MANTLE OVERVEILD THE EARTH 
HERE SOUND RETREAT AND CEASE OUR HOT PURSUIT 
BRING FORTH THE BODY OF OLD SALISBURY
AND HERE ADVANCE IT IN THE MARKETPLACE
THE MIDDLE CENTRE OF THIS CURSED TOWN 
NOW HAVE I PAID MY VOW UNTO HIS SOUL
FOR EVERY DROP OF BLOOD WAS DRAWN FROM HIM
THERE HATH AT LEAST FIVE FRENCHMEN DIED TONIGHT 
AND THAT HEREAFTER AGES MAY BEHOLD
WHAT RUIN HAPPEND IN REVENGE OF HIM
WITHIN THEIR CHIEFEST TEMPLE ILL ERECT
A TOMB WHEREIN HIS CORPSE SHALL BE INTERRD
UPON THE WHICH THAT EVERY ONE MAY READ
SHALL BE ENGRAVED THE SACK OF ORLEANS
THE TREACHEROUS MANNER OF HIS MOURNFUL DEATH
AND WHAT A TERROR HE HAD BEEN TO FRANCE 
BUT LORDS IN ALL OUR BLOODY MASSACRE
I MUSE WE MET NOT WITH THE DAUPHINS GRACE
HIS NEWCOME CHAMPION VIRTUOUS JOAN OF ARC
NOR ANY OF HIS FALSE CONFEDERATES 
TIS THOUGHT LORD TALBOT WHEN THE FIGHT BEGAN
ROUSED ON THE SUDDEN FROM THEIR DROWSY BEDS
THEY DID AMONGST THE TROOPS OF ARMED MEN
LEAP OER THE WALLS FOR REFUGE IN THE FIELD 
MYSELF AS FAR AS I COULD WELL DISCERN
FOR SMOKE AND DUSKY VAPOURS OF THE NIGHT
AM SURE I SCARED THE DAUPHIN AND HIS TRULL
WHEN ARM IN ARM THEY BOTH CAME SWIFTLY RUNNING
LIKE TO A PAIR OF LOVING TURTLEDOVES
THAT COULD NOT LIVE ASUNDER DAY OR NIGHT 
AFTER THAT THINGS ARE SET IN ORDER HERE
WELL FOLLOW THEM WITH ALL THE POWER WE HAVE 
ALL HAIL MY LORDS  WHICH OF THIS PRINCELY TRAIN
CALL YE THE WARLIKE TALBOT FOR HIS ACTS
SO MUCH APPLAUDED THROUGH THE REALM OF FRANCE
HERE IS THE TALBOT WHO WOULD SPEAK WITH HIM
THE VIRTUOUS LADY COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE
WITH MODESTY ADMIRING THY RENOWN
BY ME ENTREATS GREAT LORD THOU WOULDST VOUCHSAFE
TO VISIT HER POOR CASTLE WHERE SHE LIES
THAT SHE MAY BOAST SHE HATH BEHELD THE MAN
WHOSE GLORY FILLS THE WORLD WITH LOUD REPORT 
IS IT EVEN SO NAY THEN I SEE OUR WARS
WILL TURN UNTO A PEACEFUL COMIC SPORT
WHEN LADIES CRAVE TO BE ENCOUNTERD WITH 
YOU MAY NOT MY LORD DESPISE HER GENTLE SUIT 
NEER TRUST ME THEN FOR WHEN A WORLD OF MEN
COULD NOT PREVAIL WITH ALL THEIR ORATORY
YET HATH A WOMANS KINDNESS OVERRULED
AND THEREFORE TELL HER I RETURN GREAT THANKS
AND IN SUBMISSION WILL ATTEND ON HER 
WILL NOT YOUR HONOURS BEAR ME COMPANY
NO TRULY IT IS MORE THAN MANNERS WILL
AND I HAVE HEARD IT SAID UNBIDDEN GUESTS
ARE OFTEN WELCOMEST WHEN THEY ARE GONE 
WELL THEN ALONE SINCE THERES NO REMEDY
I MEAN TO PROVE THIS LADYS COURTESY 
COME HITHER CAPTAIN 
YOU PERCEIVE MY MIND
I DO MY LORD AND MEAN ACCORDINGLY 
PORTER REMEMBER WHAT I GAVE IN CHARGE
AND WHEN YOU HAVE DONE SO BRING THE KEYS TO ME 
MADAM I WILL 
THE PLOT IS LAID IF ALL THINGS FALL OUT RIGHT
I SHALL AS FAMOUS BE BY THIS EXPLOIT
AS SCYTHIAN TOMYRIS BY CYRUS DEATH 
GREAT IS THE RUMOR OF THIS DREADFUL KNIGHT
AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS OF NO LESS ACCOUNT
FAIN WOULD MINE EYES BE WITNESS WITH MINE EARS
TO GIVE THEIR CENSURE OF THESE RARE REPORTS 
MADAM
ACCORDING AS YOUR LADYSHIP DESIRED
BY MESSAGE CRAVED SO IS LORD TALBOT COME 
AND HE IS WELCOME  WHAT  IS THIS THE MAN
MADAM IT IS 
IS THIS THE SCOURGE OF FRANCE
IS THIS THE TALBOT SO MUCH FEARD ABROAD
THAT WITH HIS NAME THE MOTHERS STILL THEIR BABES
I SEE REPORT IS FABULOUS AND FALSE
I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN SOME HERCULES
A SECOND HECTOR FOR HIS GRIM ASPECT
AND LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS STRONGKNIT LIMBS 
ALAS THIS IS A CHILD A SILLY DWARF 
IT CANNOT BE THIS WEAK AND WRITHLED SHRIMP
SHOULD STRIKE SUCH TERROR TO HIS ENEMIES 
MADAM I HAVE BEEN BOLD TO TROUBLE YOU
BUT SINCE YOUR LADYSHIP IS NOT AT LEISURE
ILL SORT SOME OTHER TIME TO VISIT YOU 
WHAT MEANS HE NOW GO ASK HIM WHITHER HE GOES 
STAY MY LORD TALBOT FOR MY LADY CRAVES
TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF YOUR ABRUPT DEPARTURE 
MARRY FOR THAT SHES IN A WRONG BELIEF
I GO TO CERTIFY HER TALBOTS HERE 
IF THOU BE HE THEN ART THOU PRISONER 
PRISONER  TO WHOM
TO ME BLOODTHIRSTY LORD
AND FOR THAT CAUSE I TRAINED THEE TO MY HOUSE 
LONG TIME THY SHADOW HATH BEEN THRALL TO ME
FOR IN MY GALLERY THY PICTURE HANGS
BUT NOW THE SUBSTANCE SHALL ENDURE THE LIKE
AND I WILL CHAIN THESE LEGS AND ARMS OF THINE
THAT HAST BY TYRANNY THESE MANY YEARS
WASTED OUR COUNTRY SLAIN OUR CITIZENS
AND SENT OUR SONS AND HUSBANDS CAPTIVATE 
HA HA HA 
LAUGHEST THOU WRETCH THY MIRTH SHALL TURN TO MOAN 
I LAUGH TO SEE YOUR LADYSHIP SO FOND
TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE AUGHT BUT TALBOTS SHADOW
WHEREON TO PRACTISE YOUR SEVERITY 
WHY ART NOT THOU THE MAN
I AM INDEED 
THEN HAVE I SUBSTANCE TOO 
NO NO I AM BUT SHADOW OF MYSELF
YOU ARE DECEIVED MY SUBSTANCE IS NOT HERE
FOR WHAT YOU SEE IS BUT THE SMALLEST PART
AND LEAST PROPORTION OF HUMANITY
I TELL YOU MADAM WERE THE WHOLE FRAME HERE
IT IS OF SUCH A SPACIOUS LOFTY PITCH
YOUR ROOF WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO CONTAINT 
THIS IS A RIDDLING MERCHANT FOR THE NONCE
HE WILL BE HERE AND YET HE IS NOT HERE
HOW CAN THESE CONTRARIETIES AGREE
THAT WILL I SHOW YOU PRESENTLY 
HOW SAY YOU MADAM ARE YOU NOW PERSUADED
THAT TALBOT IS BUT SHADOW OF HIMSELF
THESE ARE HIS SUBSTANCE SINEWS ARMS AND STRENGTH
WITH WHICH HE YOKETH YOUR REBELLIOUS NECKS
RAZETH YOUR CITIES AND SUBVERTS YOUR TOWNS
AND IN A MOMENT MAKES THEM DESOLATE 
VICTORIOUS TALBOT  PARDON MY ABUSE
I FIND THOU ART NO LESS THAN FAME HATH BRUITED
AND MORE THAN MAY BE GATHERD BY THY SHAPE 
LET MY PRESUMPTION NOT PROVOKE THY WRATH
FOR I AM SORRY THAT WITH REVERENCE
I DID NOT ENTERTAIN THEE AS THOU ART 
BE NOT DISMAYD FAIR LADY NOR MISCONSTRUE
THE MIND OF TALBOT AS YOU DID MISTAKE
THE OUTWARD COMPOSITION OF HIS BODY 
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HATH NOT OFFENDED ME
NOR OTHER SATISFACTION DO I CRAVE
BUT ONLY WITH YOUR PATIENCE THAT WE MAY
TASTE OF YOUR WINE AND SEE WHAT CATES YOU HAVE
FOR SOLDIERS STOMACHS ALWAYS SERVE THEM WELL 
WITH ALL MY HEART AND THINK ME HONOURED
TO FEAST SO GREAT A WARRIOR IN MY HOUSE 
GREAT LORDS AND GENTLEMEN WHAT MEANS THIS SILENCE
DARE NO MAN ANSWER IN A CASE OF TRUTH
WITHIN THE TEMPLEHALL WE WERE TOO LOUD
THE GARDEN HERE IS MORE CONVENIENT 
THEN SAY AT ONCE IF I MAINTAIND THE TRUTH
OR ELSE WAS WRANGLING SOMERSET IN THE ERROR
FAITH I HAVE BEEN A TRUANT IN THE LAW
AND NEVER YET COULD FRAME MY WILL TO IT
AND THEREFORE FRAME THE LAW UNTO MY WILL 
JUDGE YOU MY LORD OF WARWICK THEN BETWEEN US 
BETWEEN TWO HAWKS WHICH FLIES THE HIGHER PITCH
BETWEEN TWO DOGS WHICH HATH THE DEEPER MOUTH
BETWEEN TWO BLADES WHICH BEARS THE BETTER TEMPER
BETWEEN TWO HORSES WHICH DOTH BEAR HIM BEST
BETWEEN TWO GIRLS WHICH HATH THE MERRIEST EYE
I HAVE PERHAPS SOME SHALLOW SPIRIT OF JUDGEMENT
BUT IN THESE NICE SHARP QUILLETS OF THE LAW
GOOD FAITH I AM NO WISER THAN A DAW 
TUT TUT HERE IS A MANNERLY FORBEARANCE
THE TRUTH APPEARS SO NAKED ON MY SIDE
THAT ANY PURBLIND EYE MAY FIND IT OUT 
AND ON MY SIDE IT IS SO WELL APPARELLD
SO CLEAR SO SHINING AND SO EVIDENT
THAT IT WILL GLIMMER THROUGH A BLIND MANS EYE 
SINCE YOU ARE TONGUETIED AND SO LOATH TO SPEAK
IN DUMB SIGNIFICANTS PROCLAIM YOUR THOUGHTS
LET HIM THAT IS A TRUEBORN GENTLEMAN
AND STANDS UPON THE HONOUR OF HIS BIRTH
IF HE SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE PLEADED TRUTH
FROM OFF THIS BRIER PLUCK A WHITE ROSE WITH ME 
LET HIM THAT IS NO COWARD NOR NO FLATTERER
BUT DARE MAINTAIN THE PARTY OF THE TRUTH
PLUCK A RED ROSE FROM OFF THIS THORN WITH ME 
I LOVE NO COLOURS AND WITHOUT ALL COLOUR
OF BASE INSINUATING FLATTERY
I PLUCK THIS WHITE ROSE WITH PLANTAGENET 
I PLUCK THIS RED ROSE WITH YOUNG SOMERSET
AND SAY WITHAL I THINK HE HELD THE RIGHT 
STAY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN AND PLUCK NO MORE
TILL YOU CONCLUDE THAT HE UPON WHOSE SIDE
THE FEWEST ROSES ARE CROPPD FROM THE TREE
SHALL YIELD THE OTHER IN THE RIGHT OPINION 
GOOD MASTER VERNON IT IS WELL OBJECTED
IF I HAVE FEWEST I SUBSCRIBE IN SILENCE 
AND I 
THEN FOR THE TRUTH AND PLAINNESS OF THE CASE 
I PLUCK THIS PALE AND MAIDEN BLOSSOM HERE
GIVING MY VERDICT ON THE WHITE ROSE SIDE 
PRICK NOT YOUR FINGER AS YOU PLUCK IT OFF
LEST BLEEDING YOU DO PAINT THE WHITE ROSE RED
AND FALL ON MY SIDE SO AGAINST YOUR WILL 
IF I MY LORD FOR MY OPINION BLEED
OPINION SHALL BE SURGEON TO MY HURT
AND KEEP ME ON THE SIDE WHERE STILL I AM 
WELL WELL COME ON WHO ELSE
UNLESS MY STUDY AND MY BOOKS BE FALSE
THE ARGUMENT YOU HELD WAS WRONG IN YOU
IN SIGN WHEREOF I PLUCK A WHITE ROSE TOO 
NOW SOMERSET WHERE IS YOUR ARGUMENT
HERE IN MY SCABBARD MEDITATING THAT
SHALL DYE YOUR WHITE ROSE IN A BLOODY RED 
MEANTIME YOUR CHEEKS DO COUNTERFEIT OUR ROSES
FOR PALE THEY LOOK WITH FEAR AS WITNESSING
THE TRUTH ON OUR SIDE 
NO PLANTAGENET
TIS NOT FOR FEAR BUT ANGER THAT THY CHEEKS
BLUSH FOR PURE SHAME TO COUNTERFEIT OUR ROSES
AND YET THY TONGUE WILL NOT CONFESS THY ERROR 
HATH NOT THY ROSE A CANKER SOMERSET
HATH NOT THY ROSE A THORN PLANTAGENET
AY SHARP AND PIERCING TO MAINTAIN HIS TRUTH
WHILES THY CONSUMING CANKER EATS HIS FALSEHOOD 
WELL ILL FIND FRIENDS TO WEAR MY BLEEDING ROSES
THAT SHALL MAINTAIN WHAT I HAVE SAID IS TRUE
WHERE FALSE PLANTAGENET DARE NOT BE SEEN 
NOW BY THIS MAIDEN BLOSSOM IN MY HAND
I SCORN THEE AND THY FASHION PEEVISH BOY

PROUD POLE I WILL AND SCORN BOTH HIM AND THEE 
ILL TURN MY PART THEREOF INTO THY THROAT

IN YOUR BEHALF STILL WILL I WEAR THE SAME 
AND SO WILL I 
THANKS GENTLE SIR 
COME LET US FOUR TO DINNER I DARE SAY
THIS QUARREL WILL DRINK BLOOD ANOTHER DAY 
KIND KEEPERS OF MY WEAK DECAYING AGE
LET DYING MORTIMER HERE REST HIMSELF 
EVEN LIKE A MAN NEW HALED FROM THE RACK
SO FARE MY LIMBS WITH LONG IMPRISONMENT 
AND THESE GREY LOCKS THE PURSUIVANTS OF DEATH
NESTORLIKE AGED IN AN AGE OF CARE
ARGUE THE END OF EDMUND MORTIMER 
THESE EYES LIKE LAMPS WHOSE WASTING OIL IS SPENT
WAX DIM AS DRAWING TO THEIR EXIGENT
WEAK SHOULDERS OVERBORNE WITH BURTHENING GRIEF
AND PITHLESS ARMS LIKE TO A WITHERD VINE
THAT DROOPS HIS SAPLESS BRANCHES TO THE GROUND
YET ARE THESE FEET WHOSE STRENGTHLESS STAY IS NUMB
UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS LUMP OF CLAY
SWIFTWINGED WITH DESIRE TO GET A GRAVE
AS WITTING I NO OTHER COMFORT HAVE 
BUT TELL ME KEEPER WILL MY NEPHEW COME
RICHARD PLANTAGENET MY LORD WILL COME
WE SENT UNTO THE TEMPLE UNTO HIS CHAMBER
AND ANSWER WAS RETURND THAT HE WILL COME 
ENOUGH MY SOUL SHALL THEN BE SATISFIED 
POOR GENTLEMAN  HIS WRONG DOTH EQUAL MINE 
SINCE HENRY MONMOUTH FIRST BEGAN TO REIGN
BEFORE WHOSE GLORY I WAS GREAT IN ARMS
THIS LOATHSOME SEQUESTRATION HAVE I HAD
AND EVEN SINCE THEN HATH RICHARD BEEN OBSCURED
DEPRIVED OF HONOUR AND INHERITANCE 
BUT NOW THE ARBITRATOR OF DESPAIRS
JUST DEATH KIND UMPIRE OF MENS MISERIES
WITH SWEET ENLARGEMENT DOTH DISMISS ME HENCE
I WOULD HIS TROUBLES LIKEWISE WERE EXPIRED
THAT SO HE MIGHT RECOVER WHAT WAS LOST 
MY LORD YOUR LOVING NEPHEW NOW IS COME 
RICHARD PLANTAGENET MY FRIEND IS HE COME
AY NOBLE UNCLE THUS IGNOBLY USED
YOUR NEPHEW LATE DESPISED RICHARD COMES 
DIRECT MINE ARMS I MAY EMBRACE HIS NECK
AND IN HIS BOSOM SPEND MY LATTER GASP
O TELL ME WHEN MY LIPS DO TOUCH HIS CHEEKS
THAT I MAY KINDLY GIVE ONE FAINTING KISS 
AND NOW DECLARE SWEET STEM FROM YORKS GREAT STOCK
WHY DIDST THOU SAY OF LATE THOU WERT DESPISED
FIRST LEAN THINE AGED BACK AGAINST MINE ARM
AND IN THAT EASE ILL TELL THEE MY DISEASE 
THIS DAY IN ARGUMENT UPON A CASE
SOME WORDS THERE GREW TWIXT SOMERSET AND ME
AMONG WHICH TERMS HE USED HIS LAVISH TONGUE
AND DID UPBRAID ME WITH MY FATHERS DEATH
WHICH OBLOQUY SET BARS BEFORE MY TONGUE
ELSE WITH THE LIKE I HAD REQUITED HIM 
THEREFORE GOOD UNCLE FOR MY FATHERS SAKE
IN HONOUR OF A TRUE PLANTAGENET
AND FOR ALLIANCE SAKE DECLARE THE CAUSE
MY FATHER EARL OF CAMBRIDGE LOST HIS HEAD 
THAT CAUSE FAIR NEPHEW THAT IMPRISOND ME
AND HATH DETAIND ME ALL MY FLOWERING YOUTH
WITHIN A LOATHSOME DUNGEON THERE TO PINE
WAS CURSED INSTRUMENT OF HIS DECEASE 
DISCOVER MORE AT LARGE WHAT CAUSE THAT WAS
FOR I AM IGNORANT AND CANNOT GUESS 
I WILL IF THAT MY FADING BREATH PERMIT
AND DEATH APPROACH NOT ERE MY TALE BE DONE 
HENRY THE FOURTH GRANDFATHER TO THIS KING
DEPOSED HIS NEPHEW RICHARD EDWARDS SON
THE FIRSTBEGOTTEN AND THE LAWFUL HEIR
OF EDWARD KING THE THIRD OF THAT DESCENT
DURING WHOSE REIGN THE PERCIES OF THE NORTH
FINDING HIS USURPATION MOST UNJUST
ENDEAVORD MY ADVANCEMENT TO THE THRONE
THE REASON MOVED THESE WARLIKE LORDS TO THIS
WAS FOR THAT YOUNG KING RICHARD THUS REMOVED
LEAVING NO HEIR BEGOTTEN OF HIS BODY 
I WAS THE NEXT BY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE
FOR BY MY MOTHER I DERIVED AM
FROM LIONEL DUKE OF CLARENCE THE THIRD SON
TO KING EDWARD THE THIRD WHEREAS HE
FROM JOHN OF GAUNT DOTH BRING HIS PEDIGREE
BEING BUT FOURTH OF THAT HEROIC LINE 
BUT MARK AS IN THIS HAUGHTY ATTEMPT
THEY LABOURED TO PLANT THE RIGHTFUL HEIR
I LOST MY LIBERTY AND THEY THEIR LIVES 
LONG AFTER THIS WHEN HENRY THE FIFTH
SUCCEEDING HIS FATHER BOLINGBROKE DID REIGN
THY FATHER EARL OF CAMBRIDGE THEN DERIVED
FROM FAMOUS EDMUND LANGLEY DUKE OF YORK
MARRYING MY SISTER THAT THY MOTHER WAS
AGAIN IN PITY OF MY HARD DISTRESS
LEVIED AN ARMY WEENING TO REDEEM
AND HAVE INSTALLD ME IN THE DIADEM
BUT AS THE REST SO FELL THAT NOBLE EARL
AND WAS BEHEADED  THUS THE MORTIMERS
IN WHOM THE TIDE RESTED WERE SUPPRESSD 
OF WHICH MY LORD YOUR HONOUR IS THE LAST 
TRUE AND THOU SEEST THAT I NO ISSUE HAVE
AND THAT MY FAINTING WORDS DO WARRANT DEATH
THOU ART MY HEIR THE REST I WISH THEE GATHER
BUT YET BE WARY IN THY STUDIOUS CARE 
THY GRAVE ADMONISHMENTS PREVAIL WITH ME
BUT YET METHINKS MY FATHERS EXECUTION
WAS NOTHING LESS THAN BLOODY TYRANNY 
WITH SILENCE NEPHEW BE THOU POLITIC
STRONGFIXED IS THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER
AND LIKE A MOUNTAIN NOT TO BE REMOVED 
BUT NOW THY UNCLE IS REMOVING HENCE
AS PRINCES DO THEIR COURTS WHEN THEY ARE CLOYD
WITH LONG CONTINUANCE IN A SETTLED PLACE 
O UNCLE WOULD SOME PART OF MY YOUNG YEARS
MIGHT BUT REDEEM THE PASSAGE OF YOUR AGE 
THOU DOST THEN WRONG ME AS THAT SLAUGHTERER DOTH
WHICH GIVETH MANY WOUNDS WHEN ONE WILL KILL 
MOURN NOT EXCEPT THOU SORROW FOR MY GOOD
ONLY GIVE ORDER FOR MY FUNERAL
AND SO FAREWELL AND FAIR BE ALL THY HOPES
AND PROSPEROUS BE THY LIFE IN PEACE AND WAR 
AND PEACE NO WAR BEFALL THY PARTING SOUL 
IN PRISON HAST THOU SPENT A PILGRIMAGE
AND LIKE A HERMIT OVERPASSD THY DAYS 
WELL I WILL LOCK HIS COUNSEL IN MY BREAST
AND WHAT I DO IMAGINE LET THAT REST 
KEEPERS CONVEY HIM HENCE AND I MYSELF
WILL SEE HIS BURIAL BETTER THAN HIS LIFE 
HERE DIES THE DUSKY TORCH OF MORTIMER
CHOKED WITH AMBITION OF THE MEANER SORT
AND FOR THOSE WRONGS THOSE BITTER INJURIES
WHICH SOMERSET HATH OFFERD TO MY HOUSE
I DOUBT NOT BUT WITH HONOUR TO REDRESS
AND THEREFORE HASTE I TO THE PARLIAMENT
EITHER TO BE RESTORED TO MY BLOOD
OR MAKE MY ILL THE ADVANTAGE OF MY GOOD 
COMEST THOU WITH DEEP PREMEDITATED LINES
WITH WRITTEN PAMPHLETS STUDIOUSLY DEVISED
HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER IF THOU CANST ACCUSE
OR AUGHT INTENDST TO LAY UNTO MY CHARGE
DO IT WITHOUT INVENTION SUDDENLY
AS I WITH SUDDEN AND EXTEMPORAL SPEECH
PURPOSE TO ANSWER WHAT THOU CANST OBJECT 
PRESUMPTUOUS PRIEST  THIS PLACE COMMANDS MY PATIENCE
OR THOU SHOULDST FIND THOU HAST DISHONOURD ME 
THINK NOT ALTHOUGH IN WRITING I PREFERRD
THE MANNER OF THY VILE OUTRAGEOUS CRIMES
THAT THEREFORE I HAVE FORGED OR AM NOT ABLE
VERBATIM TO REHEARSE THE METHOD OF MY PEN
NO PRELATE SUCH IS THY AUDACIOUS WICKEDNESS
THY LEWD PESTIFEROUS AND DISSENTIOUS PRANKS
AS VERY INFANTS PRATTLE OF THY PRIDE 
THOU ART A MOST PERNICIOUS USURER
FORWARD BY NATURE ENEMY TO PEACE
LASCIVIOUS WANTON MORE THAN WELL BESEEMS
A MAN OF THY PROFESSION AND DEGREE
AND FOR THY TREACHERY WHATS MORE MANIFEST
IN THAT THOU LAIDST A TRAP TO TAKE MY LIFE
AS WELL AT LONDON BRIDGE AS AT THE TOWER 
BESIDE I FEAR ME IF THY THOUGHTS WERE SIFTED
THE KING THY SOVEREIGN IS NOT QUITE EXEMPT
FROM ENVIOUS MALICE OF THY SWELLING HEART 
GLOUCESTER I DO DEFY THEE  LORDS VOUCHSAFE
TO GIVE ME HEARING WHAT I SHALL REPLY 
IF I WERE COVETOUS AMBITIOUS OR PERVERSE
AS HE WILL HAVE ME HOW AM I SO POOR
OR HOW HAPS IT I SEEK NOT TO ADVANCE
OR RAISE MYSELF BUT KEEP MY WONTED CALLING
AND FOR DISSENSION WHO PREFERRETH PEACE
MORE THAN I DO EXCEPT I BE PROVOKED 
NO MY GOOD LORDS IT IS NOT THAT OFFENDS
IT IS NOT THAT THAT HATH INCENSED THE DUKE
IT IS BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD SWAY BUT HE
NO ONE BUT HE SHOULD BE ABOUT THE KING
AND THAT ENGENDERS THUNDER IN HIS BREAST
AND MAKES HIM ROAR THESE ACCUSATIONS FORTH 
BUT HE SHALL KNOW I AM AS GOOD 
AS GOOD 
THOU BASTARD OF MY GRANDFATHER 
AY LORDLY SIR FOR WHAT ARE YOU I PRAY
BUT ONE IMPERIOUS IN ANOTHERS THRONE
AM I NOT PROTECTOR SAUCY PRIEST
AND AM NOT I A PRELATE OF THE CHURCH
YES AS AN OUTLAW IN A CASTLE KEEPS
AND USETH IT TO PATRONAGE HIS THEFT 
UNREVERENT GLOSTER 
THOU ART REVERENT
TOUCHING THY SPIRITUAL FUNCTION NOT THY LIFE 
ROME SHALL REMEDY THIS 
ROAM THITHER THEN 
MY LORD IT WERE YOUR DUTY TO FORBEAR 
AY SEE THE BISHOP BE NOT OVERBORNE 
METHINKS MY LORD SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
AND KNOW THE OFFICE THAT BELONGS TO SUCH 
METHINKS HIS LORDSHIP SHOULD BE HUMBLER
IT FITTETH NOT A PRELATE SO TO PLEAD 
YES WHEN HIS HOLY STATE IS TOUCHD SO NEAR 
STATE HOLY OR UNHALLOWD WHAT OF THAT
IS NOT HIS GRACE PROTECTOR TO THE KING
  PLANTAGENET I SEE MUST HOLD HIS TONGUE
LEST IT BE SAID SPEAK SIRRAH WHEN YOU SHOULD
MUST YOUR BOLD VERDICT ENTER TALK WITH LORDS
ELSE WOULD I HAVE A FLING AT WINCHESTER 
UNCLES OF GLOUCESTER AND OF WINCHESTER

AS WILL THE REST SO WILLETH WINCHESTER 
IF RICHARD WILL BE TRUE NOT THAT ALONE
BUT ALL THE WHOLE INHERITANCE I GIVE
THAT DOTH BELONG UNTO THE HOUSE OF YORK
FROM WHENCE YOU SPRING BY LINEAL DESCENT 
THY HUMBLE SERVANT VOWS OBEDIENCE
AND HUMBLE SERVICE TILL THE POINT OF DEATH 
STOOP THEN AND SET YOUR KNEE AGAINST MY FOOT
AND IN REGUERDON OF THAT DUTY DONE
I GIRD THEE WITH THE VALIANT SWORD OF YORK
RISE RICHARD LIKE A TRUE PLANTAGENET
AND RISE CREATED PRINCELY DUKE OF YORK 
AND SO THRIVE RICHARD AS THY FOES MAY FALL 
AND AS MY DUTY SPRINGS SO PERISH THEY
THAT GRUDGE ONE THOUGHT AGAINST YOUR MAJESTY 
WELCOME HIGH PRINCE THE MIGHTY DUKE OF YORK 
  PERISH BASE PRINCE IGNOBLE DUKE OF YORK 
NOW WILL IT BEST AVAIL YOUR MAJESTY
TO CROSS THE SEAS AND TO BE CROWND IN FRANCE
THE PRESENCE OF A KING ENGENDERS LOVE
AMONGST HIS SUBJECTS AND HIS LOYAL FRIENDS
AS IT DISANIMATES HIS ENEMIES 
WHEN GLOUCESTER SAYS THE WORD KING HENRY GOES
FOR FRIENDLY COUNSEL CUTS OFF MANY FOES 
YOUR SHIPS ALREADY ARE IN READINESS 
AY WE MAY MARCH IN ENGLAND OR IN FRANCE
NOT SEEING WHAT IS LIKELY TO ENSUE 
THIS LATE DISSENSION GROWN BETWIXT THE PEERS
BURNS UNDER FEIGNED ASHES OF FORGED LOVE
AND WILL AT LAST BREAK OUT INTO A FLAME
AS FESTERD MEMBERS ROT BUT BY DEGREE
TILL BONES AND FLESH AND SINEWS FALL AWAY
SO WILL THIS BASE AND ENVIOUS DISCORD BREED 
AND NOW I FEAR THAT FATAL PROPHECY
WHICH IN THE TIME OF HENRY NAMED THE FIFTH
WAS IN THE MOUTH OF EVERY SUCKING BABE
THAT HENRY BORN AT MONMOUTH SHOULD WIN ALL
AND HENRY BORN AT WINDSOR LOSE ALL
WHICH IS SO PLAIN THAT EXETER DOTH WISH
HIS DAYS MAY FINISH ERE THAT HAPLESS TIME 
THESE ARE THE CITY GATES THE GATES OF ROUEN
THROUGH WHICH OUR POLICY MUST MAKE A BREACH
TAKE HEED BE WARY HOW YOU PLACE YOUR WORDS
TALK LIKE THE VULGAR SORT OF MARKET MEN
THAT COME TO GATHER MONEY FOR THEIR CORN 
IF WE HAVE ENTRANCE AS I HOPE WE SHALL
AND THAT WE FIND THE SLOTHFUL WATCH BUT WEAK
ILL BY A SIGN GIVE NOTICE TO OUR FRIENDS
THAT CHARLES THE DAUPHIN MAY ENCOUNTER THEM 
OUR SACKS SHALL BE A MEAN TO SACK THE CITY
AND WE BE LORDS AND RULERS OVER ROUEN
THEREFORE WELL KNOCK 
  QUI EST LA
PAYSANS PAUVRES GENS DE FRANCE
POOR MARKET FOLKS THAT COME TO SELL THEIR CORN 
ENTER GO IN THE MARKET BELL IS RUNG 
NOW ROUEN ILL SHAKE THY BULWARKS TO THE GROUND 
SAINT DENIS BLESS THIS HAPPY STRATAGEM 
AND ONCE AGAIN WELL SLEEP SECURE IN ROUEN 
HERE ENTERD PUCELLE AND HER PRACTISANTS
NOW SHE IS THERE HOW WILL SHE SPECIFY
WHERE IS THE BEST AND SAFEST PASSAGE IN
BY THRUSTING OUT A TORCH FROM YONDER TOWER
WHICH ONCE DISCERND SHOWS THAT HER MEANING IS
NO WAY TO THAT FOR WEAKNESS WHICH SHE ENTERD 
BEHOLD THIS IS THE HAPPY WEDDING TORCH
THAT JOINETH ROUEN UNTO HER COUNTRYMEN
BUT BURNING FATAL TO THE TALBOTITES 
SEE NOBLE CHARLES THE BEACON OF OUR FRIEND
THE BURNING TORCH IN YONDER TURRET STANDS 
NOW SHINE IT LIKE A COMET OF REVENGE
A PROPHET TO THE FALL OF ALL OUR FOES 
DEFER NO TIME DELAYS HAVE DANGEROUS ENDS
ENTER AND CRY THE DAUPHIN  PRESENTLY
AND THEN DO EXECUTION ON THE WATCH 
FRANCE THOU SHALT RUE THIS TREASON WITH THY TEARS
IF TALBOT BUT SURVIVE THY TREACHERY 
PUCELLE THAT WITCH THAT DAMNED SORCERESS
HATH WROUGHT THIS HELLISH MISCHIEF UNAWARES
THAT HARDLY WE ESCAPED THE PRIDE OF FRANCE 
GOOD MORROW GALLANTS  WANT YE CORN FOR BREAD
I THINK THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY WILL FAST
BEFORE HELL BUY AGAIN AT SUCH A RATE
TWAS FULL OF DARNEL DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE
SCOFF ON VILE FIEND AND SHAMELESS COURTEZAN 
I TRUST ERE LONG TO CHOKE THEE WITH THINE OWN
AND MAKE THEE CURSE THE HARVEST OF THAT CORN 
YOUR GRACE MAY STARVE PERHAPS BEFORE THAT TIME 
O LET NO WORDS BUT DEEDS REVENGE THIS TREASON 
WHAT WILL YOU DO GOOD GREYBEARD BREAK A LANCE
AND RUN A TILT AT DEATH WITHIN A CHAIR
FOUL FIEND OF FRANCE AND HAG OF ALL DESPITE
ENCOMPASSD WITH THY LUSTFUL PARAMOURS 
BECOMES IT THEE TO TAUNT HIS VALIANT AGE
AND TWIT WITH COWARDICE A MAN HALF DEAD
DAMSEL ILL HAVE A BOUT WITH YOU AGAIN
OR ELSE LET TALBOT PERISH WITH THIS SHAME 
ARE YE SO HOT SIR YET PUCELLE HOLD THY PEACE
IF TALBOT DO BUT THUNDER RAIN WILL FOLLOW 
GOD SPEED THE PARLIAMENT  WHO SHALL BE THE SPEAKER
DARE YE COME FORTH AND MEET US IN THE FIELD
BELIKE YOUR LORDSHIP TAKES US THEN FOR FOOLS
TO TRY IF THAT OUR OWN BE OURS OR NO 
I SPEAK NOT TO THAT RAILING HECATE
BUT UNTO THEE ALENCON AND THE REST
WILL YE LIKE SOLDIERS COME AND FIGHT IT OUT
SIGNIOR NO 
SIGNIOR HANG  BASE MULETERS OF FRANCE 
LIKE PEASANT FOOTBOYS DO THEY KEEP THE WALLS
AND DARE NOT TAKE UP ARMS LIKE GENTLEMEN 
AWAY CAPTAINS  LETS GET US FROM THE WALLS
FOR TALBOT MEANS NO GOODNESS BY HIS LOOKS 
GOD BE WI YOU MY LORD  WE CAME BUT TO TELL YOU
THAT WE ARE HERE 
AND THERE WILL WE BE TOO ERE IT BE LONG
OR ELSE REPROACH BE TALBOTS GREATEST FAME 
VOW BURGUNDY BY HONOUR OF THY HOUSE

FITTER FOR SICKNESS AND FOR CRAZY AGE 
LORD TALBOT DO NOT SO DISHONOUR ME
HERE WILL I SIT BEFORE THE WALLS OF ROUEN
AND WILL BE PARTNER OF YOUR WEAL OR WOE 
COURAGEOUS BEDFORD LET US NOW PERSUADE YOU 
NOT TO BE GONE FROM HENCE FOR ONCE I READ
THAT STOUT PENDRAGON IN HIS LITTER SICK
CAME TO THE FIELD AND VANQUISHED HIS FOES
METHINKS I SHOULD REVIVE THE SOLDIERS HEARTS
BECAUSE I EVER FOUND THEM AS MYSELF 
UNDAUNTED SPIRIT IN A DYING BREAST 
THEN BE IT SO HEAVENS KEEP OLD BEDFORD SAFE 
AND NOW NO MORE ADO BRAVE BURGUNDY
BUT GATHER WE OUR FORCES OUT OF HAND
AND SET UPON OUR BOASTING ENEMY 
WHITHER AWAY SIR JOHN FASTOLFE IN SUCH HASTE
WHITHER AWAY  TO SAVE MYSELF BY FLIGHT
WE ARE LIKE TO HAVE THE OVERTHROW AGAIN 
WHAT  WILL YOU FLY AND LEAVE LORD TALBOT
AY

COWARDLY KNIGHT  ILL FORTUNE FOLLOW THEE 
NOW QUIET SOUL DEPART WHEN HEAVEN PLEASE
FOR I HAVE SEEN OUR ENEMIES OVERTHROW 
WHAT IS THE TRUST OR STRENGTH OF FOOLISH MAN
THEY THAT OF LATE WERE DARING WITH THEIR SCOFFS
ARE GLAD AND FAIN BY FLIGHT TO SAVE THEMSELVES 
LOST AND RECOVERD IN A DAY AGAIN 
THIS IS A DOUBLE HONOUR BURGUNDY
YET HEAVENS HAVE GLORY FOR THIS VICTORY 
WARLIKE AND MARTIAL TALBOT BURGUNDY
ENSHRINES THEE IN HIS HEART AND THERE ERECTS
THY NOBLE DEEDS AS VALOURS MONUMENTS 
THANKS GENTLE DUKE  BUT WHERE IS PUCELLE NOW
I THINK HER OLD FAMILIAR IS ASLEEP
NOW WHERES THE BASTARDS BRAVES AND CHARLES HIS GLEEKS
WHAT ALL AMORT ROUEN HANGS HER HEAD FOR GRIEF
THAT SUCH A VALIANT COMPANY ARE FLED 
NOW WILL WE TAKE SOME ORDER IN THE TOWN
PLACING THEREIN SOME EXPERT OFFICERS
AND THEN DEPART TO PARIS TO THE KING
FOR THERE YOUNG HENRY WITH HIS NOBLES LIE 
WHAT WILLS LORD TALBOT PLEASETH BURGUNDY 
BUT YET BEFORE WE GO LETS NOT FORGET
THE NOBLE DUKE OF BEDFORD LATE DECEASED
BUT SEE HIS EXEQUIES FULFILLD IN ROUEN
A BRAVER SOLDIER NEVER COUCHED LANCE
A GENTLER HEART DID NEVER SWAY IN COURT
BUT KINGS AND MIGHTIEST POTENTATES MUST DIE
FOR THATS THE END OF HUMAN MISERY 
DISMAY NOT PRINCES AT THIS ACCIDENT
NOR GRIEVE THAT ROUEN IS SO RECOVERED
CARE IS NO CURE BUT RATHER CORROSIVE
FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT TO BE REMEDIED 
LET FRANTIC TALBOT TRIUMPH FOR A WHILE
AND LIKE A PEACOCK SWEEP ALONG HIS TAIL
WELL PULL HIS PLUMES AND TAKE AWAY HIS TRAIN
IF DAUPHIN AND THE REST WILL BE BUT RULED 
WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THEE HITHERTO
AND OF THY CUNNING HAD NO DIFFIDENCE
ONE SUDDEN FOIL SHALL NEVER BREED DISTRUST 
SEARCH OUT THY WIT FOR SECRET POLICIES
AND WE WILL MAKE THEE FAMOUS THROUGH THE WORLD 
WELL SET THY STATUE IN SOME HOLY PLACE
AND HAVE THEE REVERENCED LIKE A BLESSED SAINT
EMPLOY THEE THEN SWEET VIRGIN FOR OUR GOOD 
THEN THUS IT MUST BE THIS DOTH JOAN DEVISE
BY FAIR PERSUASIONS MIXD WITH SUGARD WORDS
WE WILL ENTICE THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY
TO LEAVE THE TALBOT AND TO FOLLOW US 
AY MARRY SWEETING IF WE COULD DO THAT
FRANCE WERE NO PLACE FOR HENRYS WARRIORS
NOR SHOULD THAT NATION BOAST IT SO WITH US
BUT BE EXTIRPED FROM OUR PROVINCES 
FOR EVER SHOULD THEY BE EXPULSED FROM FRANCE
AND NOT HAVE TITLE OF AN EARLDOM HERE 
YOUR HONOURS SHALL PERCEIVE HOW I WILL WORK
TO BRING THIS MATTER TO THE WISHED END 
HARK  BY THE SOUND OF DRUM YOU MAY PERCEIVE

AND WHILES THE HONOURABLE CAPTAIN THERE
DROPS BLOODY SWEAT FROM HIS WARWEARIED LIMBS
AND IN ADVANTAGE LINGERING LOOKS FOR RESCUE

KEEP OFF ALOOF WITH WORTHLESS EMULATION 
LET NOT YOUR PRIVATE DISCORD KEEP AWAY
THE LEVIED SUCCORS THAT SHOULD LEND HIM AID
WHILE HE RENOWNED NOBLE GENTLEMAN
YIELDS UP HIS LIFE UNTO A WORLD OF ODDS
ORLEANS THE BASTARD CHARLES BURGUNDY
ALENCON REIGNIER COMPASS HIM ABOUT
AND TALBOT PERISHETH BY YOUR DEFAULT 
YORK SET HIM ON YORK SHOULD HAVE SENT HIM AID 
AND YORK AS FAST UPON YOUR GRACE EXCLAIMS
SWEARING THAT YOU WITHHOLD HIS LEVIED HOST
COLLECTED FOR THIS EXPEDITION 
YORK LIES HE MIGHT HAVE SENT AND HAD THE HORSE
I OWE HIM LITTLE DUTY AND LESS LOVE
AND TAKE FOUL SCORN TO FAWN ON HIM BY SENDING 
THE FRAUD OF ENGLAND NOT THE FORCE OF FRANCE
HATH NOW ENTRAPPD THE NOBLEMINDED TALBOT
NEVER TO ENGLAND SHALL HE BEAR HIS LIFE
BUT DIES BETRAYD TO FORTUNE BY YOUR STRIFE

FLY TO REVENGE MY DEATH IF I BE SLAIN 
HE THAT FLIES SO WILL NEER RETURN AGAIN 
IF WE BOTH STAY WE BOTH ARE SURE TO DIE

MY WORTH UNKNOWN NO LOSS IS KNOWN IN ME 
UPON MY DEATH THE FRENCH CAN LITTLE BOAST

FLIGHT CANNOT STAIN THE HONOUR YOU HAVE WON
BUT MINE IT WILL THAT NO EXPLOIT HAVE DONE
YOU FLED FOR VANTAGE EVERYONE WILL SWEAR
BUT IF I BOW THEYLL SAY IT WAS FOR FEAR 
THERE IS NO HOPE THAT EVER I WILL STAY
IF THE FIRST HOUR I SHRINK AND RUN AWAY 
HERE ON MY KNEE I BEG MORTALITY
RATHER THAN LIFE PRESERVED WITH INFAMY

OUR GREAT PROGENITORS HAD CONQUERED
O WARWICK WARWICK  I FORESEE WITH GRIEF
THE UTTER LOSS OF ALL THE REALM OF FRANCE 
BE PATIENT YORK IF WE CONCLUDE A PEACE
IT SHALL BE WITH SUCH STRICT AND SEVERE COVENANTS
AS LITTLE SHALL THE FRENCHMEN GAIN THEREBY 
SINCE LORDS OF ENGLAND IT IS THUS AGREED
THAT PEACEFUL TRUCE SHALL BE PROCLAIMD IN FRANCE
WE COME TO BE INFORMED BY YOURSELVES
WHAT THE CONDITIONS OF THAT LEAGUE MUST BE 
SPEAK WINCHESTER FOR BOILING CHOLER CHOKES
THE HOLLOW PASSAGE OF MY POISOND VOICE
BY SIGHT OF THESE OUR BALEFUL ENEMIES 
CHARLES AND THE REST IT IS ENACTED THUS
THAT IN REGARD KING HENRY GIVES CONSENT
OF MERE COMPASSION AND OF LENITY
TO EASE YOUR COUNTRY OF DISTRESSFUL WAR
AND SUFFER YOU TO BREATHE IN FRUITFUL PEACE
YOU SHALL BECOME TRUE LIEGEMEN TO HIS CROWN
AND CHARLES UPON CONDITION THOU WILT SWEAR
TO PAY HIM TRIBUTE SUBMIT THYSELF
THOU SHALT BE PLACED AS VICEROY UNDER HIM
AND STILL ENJOY THY REGAL DIGNITY 
MUST HE BE THEN AS SHADOW OF HIMSELF
ADORN HIS TEMPLES WITH A CORONET
AND YET IN SUBSTANCE AND AUTHORITY
RETAIN BUT PRIVILEGE OF A PRIVATE MAN
THIS PROFFER IS ABSURD AND REASONLESS 
TIS KNOWN ALREADY THAT I AM POSSESSD
WITH MORE THAN HALF THE GALLIAN TERRITORIES
AND THEREIN REVERENCED FOR THEIR LAWFUL KING
SHALL I FOR LUCRE OF THE REST UNVANQUISHD
DETRACT SO MUCH FROM THAT PREROGATIVE
AS TO BE CALLD BUT VICEROY OF THE WHOLE
NO LORD AMBASSADOR ILL RATHER KEEP
THAT WHICH I HAVE THAN COVETING FOR MORE
BE CAST FROM POSSIBILITY OF ALL 
INSULTING CHARLES  HAST THOU BY SECRET MEANS
USED INTERCESSION TO OBTAIN A LEAGUE
AND NOW THE MATTER GROWS TO COMPROMISE
STANDST THOU ALOOF UPON COMPARISON
EITHER ACCEPT THE TITLE THOU USURPST
OF BENEFIT PROCEEDING FROM OUR KING
AND NOT OF ANY CHALLENGE OF DESERT
OR WE WILL PLAGUE THEE WITH INCESSANT WARS 
MY LORD YOU DO NOT WELL IN OBSTINACY
TO CAVIL IN THE COURSE OF THIS CONTRACT
IF ONCE IT BE NEGLECTED TEN TO ONE
WE SHALL NOT FIND LIKE OPPORTUNITY 
TO SAY THE TRUTH IT IS YOUR POLICY
TO SAVE YOUR SUBJECTS FROM SUCH MASSACRE
AND RUTHLESS SLAUGHTERS AS ARE DAILY SEEN
BY OUR PROCEEDING IN HOSTILITY
AND THEREFORE TAKE THIS COMPACT OF A TRUCE
ALTHOUGH YOU BREAK IT WHEN YOUR PLEASURE SERVES 
HOW SAYST THOU CHARLES SHALL OUR CONDITION STAND
IT SHALL
ONLY RESERVED YOU CLAIM NO INTEREST
IN ANY OF OUR TOWNS OF GARRISON 
THEN SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO HIS MAJESTY
AS THOU ART KNIGHT NEVER TO DISOBEY
NOR BE REBELLIOUS TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND
THOU NOR THY NOBLES TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND 
SO NOW DISMISS YOUR ARMY WHEN YE PLEASE
HANG UP YOUR ENSIGN LET YOUR DRUMS BE STILL
FOR HERE WE ENTERTAIN A SOLEMN PEACE 
YOUR WONDROUS RARE DESCRIPTION NOBLE EARL
OF BEAUTEOUS MARGARET HATH ASTONISHD ME
HER VIRTUES GRACED WITH EXTERNAL GIFTS
DO BREED LOVES SETTLED PASSIONS IN MY HEART
AND LIKE AS RIGOR OF TEMPESTUOUS GUSTS
PROVOKES THE MIGHTIEST HULK AGAINST THE TIDE
SO AM I DRIVEN BY BREATH OF HER RENOWN
EITHER TO SUFFER SHIPWRECK OR ARRIVE
WHERE I MAY HAVE FRUITION OF HER LOVE 
TUSH MY GOOD LORD THIS SUPERFICIAL TALE
IS BUT A PREFACE OF HER WORTHY PRAISE
THE CHIEF PERFECTIONS OF THAT LOVELY DAME
HAD I SUFFICIENT SKILL TO UTTER THEM
WOULD MAKE A VOLUME OF ENTICING LINES
ABLE TO RAVISH ANY DULL CONCEIT
AND WHICH IS MORE SHE IS NOT SO DIVINE
SO FULLREPLETE WITH CHOICE OF ALL DELIGHTS
BUT WITH AS HUMBLE LOWLINESS OF MIND
SHE IS CONTENT TO BE AT YOUR COMMAND
COMMAND I MEAN OF VIRTUOUS CHASTE INTENTS
TO LOVE AND HONOUR HENRY AS HER LORD 
AND OTHERWISE WILL HENRY NEER PRESUME 
THEREFORE MY LORD PROTECTOR GIVE CONSENT
THAT MARGARET MAY BE ENGLANDS ROYAL QUEEN 
SO SHOULD I GIVE CONSENT TO FLATTER SIN 
YOU KNOW MY LORD YOUR HIGHNESS IS BETROTHD
UNTO ANOTHER LADY OF ESTEEM
HOW SHALL WE THEN DISPENSE WITH THAT CONTRACT
AND NOT DEFACE YOUR HONOUR WITH REPROACH
AS DOTH A RULER WITH UNLAWFUL OATHS
OR ONE THAT AT A TRIUMPH HAVING VOWD
TO TRY HIS STRENGTH FORSAKETH YET THE LISTS
BY REASON OF HIS ADVERSARYS ODDS
A POOR EARLS DAUGHTER IS UNEQUAL ODDS
AND THEREFORE MAY BE BROKE WITHOUT OFFENCE 
WHY WHAT I PRAY IS MARGARET MORE THAN THAT
HER FATHER IS NO BETTER THAN AN EARL
ALTHOUGH IN GLORIOUS TITLES HE EXCEL 
YES LORD HER FATHER IS A KING
THE KING OF NAPLES AND JERUSALEM
AND OF SUCH GREAT AUTHORITY IN FRANCE
AS HIS ALLIANCE WILL CONFIRM OUR PEACE
AND KEEP THE FRENCHMEN IN ALLEGIANCE 
AND SO THE EARL OF ARMAGNAC MAY DO
BECAUSE HE IS NEAR KINSMAN UNTO CHARLES 
BESIDE HIS WEALTH DOTH WARRANT A LIBERAL DOWER
WHERE REIGNIER SOONER WILL RECEIVE THAN GIVE 
A DOWER MY LORDS  DISGRACE NOT SO YOUR KING
THAT HE SHOULD BE SO ABJECT BASE AND POOR
TO CHOOSE FOR WEALTH AND NOT FOR PERFECT LOVE 
HENRY IS ABLE TO ENRICH HIS QUEEN
AND NOT SEEK A QUEEN TO MAKE HIM RICH
SO WORTHLESS PEASANTS BARGAIN FOR THEIR WIVES
AS MARKETMEN FOR OXEN SHEEP OR HORSE 
MARRIAGE IS A MATTER OF MORE WORTH
THAN TO BE DEALT IN BY ATTORNEYSHIP
NOT WHOM WE WILL BUT WHOM HIS GRACE AFFECTS
MUST BE COMPANION OF HIS NUPTIAL BED
AND THEREFORE LORDS SINCE HE AFFECTS HER MOST
IT MOST OF ALL THESE REASONS BINDETH US
IN OUR OPINIONS SHE SHOULD BE PREFERRD 
FOR WHAT IS WEDLOCK FORCED BUT A HELL
AN AGE OF DISCORD AND CONTINUAL STRIFE
WHEREAS THE CONTRARY BRINGETH BLISS
AND IS A PATTERN OF CELESTIAL PEACE 
WHOM SHOULD WE MATCH WITH HENRY BEING A KING
BUT MARGARET THAT IS DAUGHTER TO A KING
HER PEERLESS FEATURE JOINED WITH HER BIRTH
APPROVES HER FIT FOR NONE BUT FOR A KING
HER VALIANT COURAGE AND UNDAUNTED SPIRIT
MORE THAN IN WOMEN COMMONLY IS SEEN
WILL ANSWER OUR HOPE IN ISSUE OF A KING
FOR HENRY SON UNTO A CONQUEROR
IS LIKELY TO BEGET MORE CONQUERORS
IF WITH A LADY OF SO HIGH RESOLVE
AS IS FAIR MARGARET HE BE LINKD IN LOVE 
THEN YIELD MY LORDS AND HERE CONCLUDE WITH ME
THAT MARGARET SHALL BE QUEEN AND NONE BUT SHE 
WHETHER IT BE THROUGH FORCE OF YOUR REPORT
MY NOBLE LORD OF SUFFOLK OR FOR THAT
MY TENDER YOUTH WAS NEVER YET ATTAINT
WITH ANY PASSION OF INFLAMING LOVE
I CANNOT TELL BUT THIS I AM ASSURED
I FEEL SUCH SHARP DISSENSION IN MY BREAST
SUCH FIERCE ALARUMS BOTH OF HOPE AND FEAR
AS I AM SICK WITH WORKING OF MY THOUGHTS 
TAKE THEREFORE SHIPPING POST MY LORD TO FRANCE
AGREE TO ANY COVENANTS AND PROCURE
THAT LADY MARGARET DO VOUCHSAFE TO COME
TO CROSS THE SEAS TO ENGLAND AND BE CROWND
KING HENRYS FAITHFUL AND ANOINTED QUEEN
FOR YOUR EXPENSES AND SUFFICIENT CHARGE
AMONG THE PEOPLE GATHER UP A TENTH 
BE GONE I SAY FOR TILL YOU DO RETURN
I REST PERPLEXED WITH A THOUSAND CARES 
AND YOU GOOD UNCLE BANISH ALL OFFENCE
IF YOU DO CENSURE ME BY WHAT YOU WERE
NOT WHAT YOU ARE I KNOW IT WILL EXCUSE
THIS SUDDEN EXECUTION OF MY WILL 
AND SO CONDUCT ME WHERE FROM COMPANY
I MAY REVOLVE AND RUMINATE MY GRIEF 
AY GRIEF I FEAR ME BOTH AT FIRST AND LAST 
THUS SUFFOLK HATH PREVAILD AND THUS HE GOES
AS DID THE YOUTHFUL PARIS ONCE TO GREECE
WITH HOPE TO FIND THE LIKE EVENT IN LOVE
BUT PROSPER BETTER THAN THE TROJAN DID 
MARGARET SHALL NOW BE QUEEN AND RULE THE KING
BUT I WILL RULE BOTH HER THE KING AND REALM
