AND BREATHE SHORTWINDED ACCENTS OF NEW BROILS
TO BE COMMENCED IN STRANDS AFAR REMOTE 
NO MORE THE THIRSTY ENTRANCE OF THIS SOIL

NOR MORE SHALL TRENCHING WAR CHANNEL HER FIELDS
NOR BRUISE HER FLOWERETS WITH THE ARMED HOOFS
OF HOSTILE PACES THOSE OPPOSED EYES
WHICH LIKE THE METEORS OF A TROUBLED HEAVEN
ALL OF ONE NATURE OF ONE SUBSTANCE BRED
DID LATELY MEET IN THE INTESTINE SHOCK
AND FURIOUS CLOSE OF CIVIL BUTCHERY
SHALL NOW IN MUTUAL WELLBESEEMING RANKS
MARCH ALL ONE WAY AND BE NO MORE OPPOSED
AGAINST ACQUAINTANCE KINDRED AND ALLIES
THE EDGE OF WAR LIKE AN ILLSHEATHED KNIFE
NO MORE SHALL CUT HIS MASTER  THEREFORE FRIENDS
AS FAR AS TO THE SEPULCHRE OF CHRIST
WHOSE SOLDIER NOW UNDER WHOSE BLESSED CROSS
WE ARE IMPRESSED AND ENGAGED TO FIGHT
FORTHWITH A POWER OF ENGLISH SHALL WE LEVY
WHOSE ARMS WERE MOULDED IN THEIR MOTHERS WOMB
TO CHASE THESE PAGANS IN THOSE HOLY FIELDS

YET HEREIN WILL I IMITATE THE SUN
WHO DOTH PERMIT THE BASE CONTAGIOUS CLOUDS
TO SMOTHER UP HIS BEAUTY FROM THE WORLD
THAT WHEN HE PLEASE AGAIN TO BE HIMSELF
BEING WANTED HE MAY BE MORE WONDERD AT
BY BREAKING THROUGH THE FOUL AND UGLY MISTS
OF VAPOURS THAT DID SEEM TO STRANGLE HIM 
IF ALL THE YEAR WERE PLAYING HOLIDAYS
TO SPORT WOULD BE AS TEDIOUS AS TO WORK
BUT WHEN THEY SELDOM COME THEY WISHD FOR COME
AND NOTHING PLEASETH BUT RARE ACCIDENTS 
SO WHEN THIS LOOSE BEHAVIOR I THROW OFF
AND PAY THE DEBT I NEVER PROMISED
BY HOW MUCH BETTER THAN MY WORD I AM
BY SO MUCH SHALL I FALSIFY MENS HOPES
AND LIKE BRIGHT METAL ON A SULLEN GROUND
MY REFORMATION GLITTERING OER MY FAULT

THAN THAT WHICH HATH NO FOIL TO SET IT OFF 
ILL SO OFFEND TO MAKE OFFENCE A SKILL
REDEEMING TIME WHEN MEN THINK LEAST I WILL 
MY BLOOD HATH BEEN TOO COLD AND TEMPERATE
UNAPT TO STIR AT THESE INDIGNITIES
AND YOU HAVE FOUND ME FOR ACCORDINGLY
YOU TREAD UPON MY PATIENCE BUT BE SURE
I WILL FROM HENCEFORTH RATHER BE MYSELF
MIGHTY AND TO BE FEARD THAN MY CONDITION
WHICH HATH BEEN SMOOTH AS OIL SOFT AS YOUNG DOWN
AND THEREFORE LOST THAT TITLE OF RESPECT
WHICH THE PROUD SOUL NEER PAYS BUT TO THE PROUD 
OUR HOUSE MY SOVEREIGN LIEGE LITTLE DESERVES
THE SCOURGE OF GREATNESS TO BE USED ON IT
AND THAT SAME GREATNESS TOO WHICH OUR OWN HANDS
HAVE HOLP TO MAKE SO PORTLY 
MY LORD  
WORCESTER GET THEE GONE FOR I DO SEE
DANGER AND DISOBEDIENCE IN THINE EYE
O SIR YOUR PRESENCE IS TOO BOLD AND PEREMPTORY
AND MAJESTY MIGHT NEVER YET ENDURE
THE MOODY FRONTIER OF A SERVANT BROW 
YOU HAVE GOOD LEAVE TO LEAVE US WHEN WE NEED
YOUR USE AND COUNSEL WE SHALL SEND FOR YOU 
YOU WERE ABOUT TO SPEAK 
YEA MY GOOD LORD 
THOSE PRISONERS IN YOUR HIGHNESS NAME DEMANDED
WHICH HARRY PERCY HERE AT HOLMEDON TOOK
WERE AS HE SAYS NOT WITH SUCH STRENGTH DENIED
AS IS DELIVERD TO YOUR MAJESTY
EITHER ENVY THEREFORE OR MISPRISON
IS GUILTY OF THIS FAULT AND NOT MY SON 
MY LIEGE I DID DENY NO PRISONERS 
BUT I REMEMBER WHEN THE FIGHT WAS DONE
WHEN I WAS DRY WITH RAGE AND EXTREME TOIL
BREATHLESS AND FAINT LEANING UPON MY SWORD
CAME THERE A CERTAIN LORD NEAT AND TRIMLY DRESSD
FRESH AS A BRIDEGROOM AND HIS CHIN NEW REAPD
SHOWD LIKE A STUBBLELAND AT HARVESTHOME
HE WAS PERFUMED LIKE A MILLINER
AND TWIXT HIS FINGER AND HIS THUMB HE HELD
A POUNCETBOX WHICH EVER AND ANON
HE GAVE HIS NOSE AND TOOKT AWAY AGAIN
WHO THEREWITH ANGRY WHEN IT NEXT CAME THERE
TOOK IT IN SNUFF AND STILL HE SMILED AND TALKD
AND AS THE SOLDIERS BORE DEAD BODIES BY
HE CALLD THEM UNTAUGHT KNAVES UNMANNERLY
TO BRING A SLOVENLY UNHANDSOME CORSE
BETWIXT THE WIND AND HIS NOBILITY 
WITH MANY HOLIDAY AND LADY TERMS
HE QUESTIOND ME AMONGST THE REST DEMANDED
MY PRISONERS IN YOUR MAJESTYS BEHALF 
I THEN ALL SMARTING WITH MY WOUNDS BEING COLD
TO BE SO PESTERD WITH A POPINJAY
OUT OF MY GRIEF AND MY IMPATIENCE
ANSWERD NEGLECTINGLY I KNOW NOT WHAT
HE SHOULD OR HE SHOULD NOT FOR HE MADE ME MAD
TO SEE HIM SHINE SO BRISK AND SMELL SO SWEET
AND TALK SO LIKE A WAITINGGENTLEWOMAN
OF GUNS AND DRUMS AND WOUNDS GOD SAVE THE MARK  
AND TELLING ME THE SOVEREIGNST THING ON EARTH
WAS PARMACETI FOR AN INWARD BRUISE
AND THAT IT WAS GREAT PITY SO IT WAS
THIS VILLANOUS SALTPETRE SHOULD BE DIGGD
OUT OF THE BOWELS OF THE HARMLESS EARTH
WHICH MANY A GOOD TALL FELLOW HAD DESTROYD
SO COWARDLY AND BUT FOR THESE VILE GUNS
HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE BEEN A SOLDIER 
THIS BALD UNJOINTED CHAT OF HIS MY LORD
I ANSWERD INDIRECTLY AS I SAID
AND I BESEECH YOU LET NOT HIS REPORT
COME CURRENT FOR AN ACCUSATION
BETWIXT MY LOVE AND YOUR HIGH MAJESTY 
THE CIRCUMSTANCE CONSIDERD GOOD MY LORD
WHATEER LORD HARRY PERCY THEN HAD SAID
TO SUCH A PERSON AND IN SUCH A PLACE
AT SUCH A TIME WITH ALL THE REST RETOLD
MAY REASONABLY DIE AND NEVER RISE
TO DO HIM WRONG OR ANY WAY IMPEACH
WHAT THEN HE SAID SO HE UNSAY IT NOW 
WHY YET HE DOTH DENY HIS PRISONERS
BUT WITH PROVISO AND EXCEPTION
THAT WE AT OUR OWN CHARGE SHALL RANSOM STRAIGHT
HIS BROTHERINLAW THE FOOLISH MORTIMER
WHO ON MY SOUL HATH WILFULLY BETRAYD
THE LIVES OF THOSE THAT HE DID LEAD TO FIGHT
AGAINST THAT GREAT MAGICIAN DAMND GLENDOWER
WHOSE DAUGHTER AS WE HEAR THE EARL OF MARCH
HATH LATELY MARRIED  SHALL OUR COFFERS THEN
BE EMPTIED TO REDEEM A TRAITOR HOME
SHALL WE BUT TREASON AND INDENT WITH FEARS
WHEN THEY HAVE LOST AND FORFEITED THEMSELVES
NO ON THE BARREN MOUNTAINS LET HIM STARVE
FOR I SHALL NEVER HOLD THAT MAN MY FRIEND
WHOSE TONGUE SHALL ASK ME FOR ONE PENNY COST
TO RANSOM HOME REVOLTED MORTIMER 
REVOLTED MORTIMER 
HE NEVER DID FALL OFF MY SOVEREIGN LIEGE
BUT BY THE CHANCE OF WAR TO PROVE THAT TRUE
NEEDS NO MORE BUT ONE TONGUE FOR ALL THOSE WOUNDS
THOSE MOUTHED WOUNDS WHICH VALIANTLY HE TOOK
WHEN ON THE GENTLE SEVERNS SEDGY BANK
IN SINGLE OPPOSITION HAND TO HAND
HE DID CONFOUND THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR
IN CHANGING HARDIMENT WITH GREAT GLENDOWER
THREE TIMES THEY BREATHED AND THREE TIMES DID
THEY DRINK
UPON AGREEMENT OF SWIFT SEVERNS FLOOD
WHO THEN AFFRIGHTED WITH THEIR BLOODY LOOKS
RAN FEARFULLY AMONG THE TREMBLING REEDS
AND HID HIS CRISP HEAD IN THE HOLLOW BANK
BLOODSTAINED WITH THESE VALIANT COMBATANTS 
NEVER DID BASE AND ROTTEN POLICY
COLOUR HER WORKING WITH SUCH DEADLY WOUNDS
NOR COULD THE NOBLE MORTIMER
RECEIVE SO MANY AND ALL WILLINGLY
THEN LET NOT HIM BE SLANDERD WITH REVOLT 
THOU DOST BELIE HIM PERCY THOU DOST BELIE HIM
HE NEVER DID ENCOUNTER WITH GLENDOWER
I TELL THEE
HE DURST AS WELL HAVE MET THE DEVIL ALONE
AS OWEN GLENDOWER FOR AN ENEMY 
ART THOU NOT ASHAMED BUT SIRRAH HENCEFORTH
LET ME NOT HEAR YOU SPEAK OF MORTIMER
SEND ME YOUR PRISONERS WITH THE SPEEDIEST MEANS
OR YOU SHALL HEAR IN SUCH A KIND FROM ME
AS WILL DISPLEASE YOU  MY LORD NORTHUMBERLAND
WE LICENCE YOUR DEPARTURE WITH YOUR SON 
SEND US YOUR PRISONERS OR YOU WILL HEAR OF IT 
AN IF THE DEVIL COME AND ROAR FOR THEM
I WILL NOT SEND THEM I WILL AFTER STRAIGHT
AND TELL HIM SO FOR I WILL EASE MY HEART
ALBEIT I MAKE A HAZARD OF MY HEAD 
WHAT DRUNK WITH CHOLER STAY AND PAUSE AWHILE
HERE COMES YOUR UNCLE 
SPEAK OF MORTIMER 
ZOUNDS I WILL SPEAK OF HIM AND LET MY SOUL
WANT MERCY IF I DO NOT JOIN WITH HIM
YEA ON HIS PART ILL EMPTY ALL THESE VEINS
AND SHED MY DEAR BLOOD DROP BY DROP IN THE DUST
BUT I WILL LIFT THE DOWNTROD MORTIMER
AS HIGH IN THE AIR AS THIS UNTHANKFUL KING
AS THIS INGRATE AND CANKERD BOLINGBROKE 
BROTHER THE KING HATH MADE YOUR NEPHEW MAD 
WHO STRUCK THIS HEAT UP AFTER I WAS GONE
HE WILL FORSOOTH HAVE ALL MY PRISONERS
AND WHEN I URGED THE RANSOM ONCE AGAIN
OF MY WIFES BROTHER THEN HIS CHEEK LOOKD PALE
AND ON MY FACE HE TURND AN EYE OF DEATH
TREMBLING EVEN AT THE NAME OF MORTIMER 
I CANNOT BLAME HIM WAS NOT HE PROCLAIMD
BY RICHARD THAT DEAD IS THE NEXT OF BLOOD
HE WAS I HEARD THE PROCLAMATION
AND THEN IT WAS WHEN THE UNHAPPY KING
 WHOSE WRONGS IN US GOD PARDON  DID SET FORTH
UPON HIS IRISH EXPEDITION
FROM WHENCE HE INTERCEPTED DID RETURN
TO BE DEPOSED AND SHORTLY MURDERED 
AND FOR WHOSE DEATH WE IN THE WORLDS WIDE MOUTH
LIVE SCANDALIZED AND FOULLY SPOKEN OF 
BUT SOFT I PRAY YOU DID KING RICHARD THEN
PROCLAIM MY BROTHER EDMUND MORTIMER
HEIR TO THE CROWN
HE DID MYSELF DID HEAR IT 
NAY THEN I CANNOT BLAME HIS COUSIN KING
THAT WISHED HIM ON THE BARREN MOUNTAINS STARVE 
BUT SHALL IT BE THAT YOU THAT SET THE CROWN
UPON THE HEAD OF THIS FORGETFUL MAN
AND FOR HIS SAKE WEAR THE DETESTED BLOT
OF MURDEROUS SUBORNATION SHALL IT BE
THAT YOU A WORLD OF CURSES UNDERGO
BEING THE AGENTS OR BASE SECOND MEANS
THE CORDS THE LADDER OR THE HANGMAN RATHER
O PARDON ME THAT I DESCEND SO LOW
TO SHOW THE LINE AND THE PREDICAMENT
WHEREIN YOU RANGE UNDER THIS SUBTLE KING
SHALL IT FOR SHAME BE SPOKEN IN THESE DAYS
OR FILL UP CHRONICLES IN TIME TO COME
THAT MEN OF YOUR NOBILITY AND POWER
DID GAGE THEM BOTH IN AN UNJUST BEHALF
AS BOTH OF YOU GOD PARDON IT  HAVE DONE
TO PUT DOWN RICHARD THAT SWEET LOVELY ROSE
AN PLANT THIS THORN THIS CANKER BOLINGBROKE
AND SHALL IT IN MORE SHAME BE FURTHER SPOKEN
THAT YOU ARE FOOLD DISCARDED AND SHOOK OFF
BY HIM FOR WHOM THESE SHAMES YE UNDERWENT
NO YET TIME SERVES WHEREIN YOU MAY REDEEM
YOUR BANISHD HONOURS AND RESTORE YOURSELVES
INTO THE GOOD THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD AGAIN
REVENGE THE JEERING AND DISDAIND CONTEMPT
OF THIS PROUD KING WHO STUDIES DAY AND NIGHT
TO ANSWER ALL THE DEBT HE OWES TO YOU
EVEN WITH THE BLOODY PAYMENT OF YOUR DEATHS
THEREFORE I SAY 
PEACE COUSIN SAY NO MORE
AND NOW I WILL UNCLASP A SECRET BOOK
AND TO YOUR QUICKCONCEIVING DISCONTENTS
ILL READ YOU MATTER DEEP AND DANGEROUS

SEND DANGER FROM THE EAST UNTO THE WEST
SO HONOUR CROSS IT FROM THE NORTH TO SOUTH
AND LET THEM GRAPPLE O THE BLOOD MORE STIRS
TO ROUSE A LION THAN TO START A HARE 
IMAGINATION OF SOME GREAT EXPLOIT
DRIVES HIM BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF PATIENCE 
BY HEAVEN METHINKS IT WERE AN EASY LEAP
TO PLUCK BRIGHT HONOUR FROM THE PALEFACED MOON
OR DIVE INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEP
WHERE FATHOMLINE COULD NEVER TOUCH THE GROUND
AND PLUCK UP DROWNED HONOUR BY THE LOCKS
SO HE THAT DOTH REDEEM HER THENCE MIGHT WEAR
WITHOUT CORRIVAL ALL HER DIGNITIES
BUT OUT UPON THIS HALFFACED FELLOWSHIP 
HE APPREHENDS A WORLD OF FIGURES HERE
BUT NOT THE FORM OF WHAT HE SHOULD ATTEND 
GOOD COUSIN GIVE ME AUDIENCE FOR A WHILE 
I CRY YOU MERCY

I KNOW NOT WHETHER GOD WILL HAVE IT SO
FOR SOME DISPLEASING SERVICE I HAVE DONE
THAT IN HIS SECRET DOOM OUT OF MY BLOOD
HELL BREED REVENGEMENT AND A SCOURGE FOR ME
BUT THOU DOST IN THY PASSAGES OF LIFE
MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT THOU ART ONLY MARKD
FOR THE HOT VENGEANCE AND THE ROD OF HEAVEN
TO PUNISH MY MISTREADINGS  TELL ME ELSE
COULD SUCH INORDINATE AND LOW DESIRES
SUCH POOR SUCH BARE SUCH LEWD SUCH MEAN ATTEMPTS
SUCH BARREN PLEASURES RUDE SOCIETY
AS THOU ART MATCHD WITHAL AND GRAFTED TO
ACCOMPANY THE GREATNESS OF THY BLOOD
AND HOLD THEIR LEVEL WITH THY PRINCELY HEART
SO PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY I WOULD I COULD
QUIT ALL OFFENCES WITH AS CLEAR EXCUSE
AS WELL AS I AM DOUBTLESS I CAN PURGE
MYSELF OF MANY I AM CHARGED WITHAL
YET SUCH EXTENUATION LET ME BEG
AS IN REPROOF OF MANY TALES DEVISED
WHICH OFT THE EAR OF GREATNESS NEEDS MUST HEAR
BY SMILING PICKTHANKS AND BASE NEWSMONGERS
I MAY FOR SOME THINGS TRUE WHEREIN MY YOUTH
HATH FAULTY WANDERD AND IRREGULAR
FIND PARDON ON MY TRUE SUBMISSION 
GOD PARDON THEE  YET LET ME WONDER HARRY
AT THY AFFECTIONS WHICH DO HOLD A WING
QUITE FROM THE FLIGHT OF ALL THY ANCESTORS 
THY PLACE IN COUNCIL THOU HAST RUDELY LOST 
WHICH BY THY YOUNGER BROTHER IS SUPPLIED
AND ART ALMOST AN ALIEN TO THE HEARTS
OF ALL THE COURT AND PRINCES OF MY BLOOD
THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION OF THY TIME
IS RUIND AND THE SOUL OF EVERY MAN
PROPHETICALLY DOTH FORETHINK THY FALL 
HAD I SO LAVISH OF MY PRESENCE BEEN
SO COMMONHACKNEYD IN THE EYES OF MEN
SO STALE AND CHEAP TO VULGAR COMPANY
OPINION THAT DID HELP ME TO THE CROWN
HAD STILL KEPT LOYAL TO POSSESSION
AND LEFT ME IN REPUTELESS BANISHMENT
A FELLOW OF NO MARK NOR LIKELIHOOD 
BY BEING SELDOM SEEN I COULD NOT STIR
BUT LIKE A COMET I WAS WONDERD AT
THAT MEN WOULD TELL THEIR CHILDREN THIS IS HE
OTHERS WOULD SAY WHERE WHICH IS BOLINGBROKE
AND THEN I STOLE ALL COURTESY FROM HEAVEN
AND DRESSD MYSELF IN SUCH HUMILITY
THAT I DID PLUCK ALLEGIANCE FROM MENS HEARTS
LOUD SHOUTS AND SALUTATIONS FROM THEIR MOUTHS
EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROWNED KING 
THUS DID I KEEP MY PERSON FRESH AND NEW
MY PRESENCE LIKE A ROBE PONTIFICAL
NEER SEEN BUT WONDERD AT AND SO MY STATE
SELDOM BUT SUMPTUOUS SHOWED LIKE A FEAST
AND WON BY RARENESS SUCH SOLEMNITY 
THE SKIPPING KING HE AMBLED UP AND DOWN
WITH SHALLOW JESTERS AND RASH BAVIN WITS
SOON KINDLED AND SOON BURNT CARDED HIS STATE
MINGLED HIS ROYALTY WITH CAPERING FOOLS
HAD HIS GREAT NAME PROFANED WITH THEIR SCORNS
AND GAVE HIS COUNTENANCE AGAINST HIS NAME
TO LAUGH AT GIBING BOYS AND STAND THE PUSH
OF EVERY BEARDLESS VAIN COMPARATIVE
GREW A COMPANION TO THE COMMON STREETS
ENFEOFFD HIMSELF TO POPULARITY
THAT BEING DAILY SWALLOWD BY MENS EYES
THEY SURFEITED WITH HONEY AND BEGAN
TO LOATHE THE TASTE OF SWEETNESS WHEREOF A LITTLE
MORE THAN A LITTLE IS BY MUCH TOO MUCH 
SO WHEN HE HAD OCCASION TO BE SEEN
HE WAS BUT AS THE CUCKOO IS IN JUNE
HEARD NOT REGARDED SEEN BUT WITH SUCH EYES
AS SICK AND BLUNTED WITH COMMUNITY
AFFORD NO EXTRAORDINARY GAZE
SUCH AS IS BENT ON SUNLIKE MAJESTY
WHEN IT SHINES SELDOM IN ADMIRING EYES
BUT RATHER DROWZED AND HUNG THEIR EYELIDS DOWN
SLEPT IN HIS FACE AND RENDERD SUCH ASPECT
AS CLOUDY MEN USE TO THEIR ADVERSARIES
BEING WITH HIS PRESENCE GLUTTED GORGED AND FULL 
AND IN THAT VERY LINE HARRY STANDEST THOU
FOR THOU HAS LOST THY PRINCELY PRIVILEGE
WITH VILE PARTICIPATION NOT AN EYE
BUT IS AWEARY OF THY COMMON SIGHT
SAVE MINE WHICH HATH DESIRED TO SEE THEE MORE
WHICH NOW DOTH THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE IT DO
MAKE BLIND ITSELF WITH FOOLISH TENDERNESS 
I SHALL HEREAFTER MY THRICE GRACIOUS LORD
BE MORE MYSELF 
FOR ALL THE WORLD
AS THOU ART TO THIS HOUR WAS RICHARD THEN
WHEN I FROM FRANCE SET FOOT AT RAVENSPURGH
AND EVEN AS I WAS THEN IS PERCY NOW 
NOW BY MY SCEPTRE AND MY SOUL TO BOOT
HE HATH MORE WORTHY INTEREST TO THE STATE
THAN THOU THE SHADOW OF SUCCESSION
FOR OF NO RIGHT NOR COLOUR LIKE TO RIGHT
HE DOTH FILL FIELDS WITH HARNESS IN THE REALM
TURNS HEAD AGAINST THE LIONS ARMED JAWS
AND BEING NO MORE IN DEBT TO YEARS THAN THOU
LEADS ANCIENT LORDS AND REVEREND BISHOPS ON
TO BLOODY BATTLES AND TO BRUISING ARMS 
WHAT NEVERDYING HONOUR HATH HE GOT
AGAINST RENOWNED DOUGLAS  WHOSE HIGH DEEDS
WHOSE HOT INCURSIONS AND GREAT NAME IN ARMS
HOLDS FROM ALL SOLDIERS CHIEF MAJORITY
AND MILITARY TITLE CAPITAL
THROUGH ALL THE KINGDOMS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE CHRIST
THRICE HATH THIS HOTSPUR MARS IN SWATHLING CLOTHES
THIS INFANT WARRIOR IN HIS ENTERPRISES
DISCOMFITED GREAT DOUGLAS TAEN HIM ONCE
ENLARGED HIM AND MADE A FRIEND OF HIM
TO FILL THE MOUTH OF DEEP DEFIANCE UP
AND SHAKE THE PEACE AND SAFETY OF OUR THRONE 
AND WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS PERCY NORTHUMBERLAND
THE ARCHBISHOPS GRACE OF YORK DOUGLAS MORTIMER
CAPITULATE AGAINST US AND ARE UP 
BUT WHEREFORE DO I TELL THESE NEWS TO THEE
WHY HARRY DO I TELL THEE OF MY FOES
WHICH ART MY NEARST AND DEAREST ENEMY
THOU THAT ART LIKE ENOUGH THROUGH VASSAL FEAR
BASE INCLINATION AND THE START OF SPLEEN
TO FIGHT AGAINST ME UNDER PERCYS PAY
TO DOG HIS HEELS AND CURTSY AT HIS FROWNS
TO SHOW HOW MUCH THOU ART DEGENERATE 
DO NOT THINK SO YOU SHALL NOT FIND IT SO
AND GOD FORGIVE THEM THAT SO MUCH HAVE SWAYD
YOUR MAJESTYS GOOD THOUGHTS AWAY FROM ME 
I WILL REDEEM ALL THIS ON PERCYS HEAD
AND IN THE CLOSING OF SOME GLORIOUS DAY
BE BOLD TO TELL YOU THAT I AM YOUR SON
WHEN I WILL WEAR A GARMENT ALL OF BLOOD
AND STAIN MY FAVOURS IN A BLOODY MASK
WHICH WASHD AWAY SHALL SCOUR MY SHAME WITH IT
AND THAT SHALL BE THE DAY WHENEER IT LIGHTS
THAT THIS SAME CHILD OF HONOUR AND RENOWN
THIS GALLANT HOTSPUR THIS ALLPRAISED KNIGHT
AND YOUR UNTHOUGHTOF HARRY CHANCE TO MEET 
FOR EVERY HONOUR SITTING ON HIS HELM
WOULD THEY WERE MULTITUDES AND ON MY HEAD
MY SHAMES REDOUBLED  FOR THE TIME WILL COME
THAT I SHALL MAKE THIS NORTHERN YOUTH EXCHANGE
HIS GLORIOUS DEEDS FOR MY INDIGNITIES 
PERCY IS BUT MY FACTOR GOOD MY LORD
TO ENGROSS UP GLORIOUS DEEDS ON MY BEHALF

HIS HEALTH WAS NEVER BETTER WORTH THAN NOW 
SICK NOW  DROOP NOW  THIS SICKNESS DOTH INFECT
THE VERY LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ENTERPRISE
TIS CATCHING HITHER EVEN TO OUR CAMP 
HE WRITES ME HERE THAT INWARD SICKNESS 
AND THAT HIS FRIENDS BY DEPUTATION COULD NOT
SO SOON BE DRAWN NOR DID HE THINK IT MEET
TO LAY SO DANGEROUS AND DEAR A TRUST
ON ANY SOUL REMOVED BUT ON HIS OWN 
YET DOTH HE GIVE US BOLD ADVERTISEMENT
THAT WITH OUR SMALL CONJUNCTION WE SHOULD ON
TO SEE HOW FORTUNE IS DISPOSED TO US
FOR AS HE WRITES THERE IS NO QUAILING NOW 
BECAUSE THE KING IS CERTAINLY POSSESSD
OF ALL OUR PURPOSES  WHAT SAY YOU TO IT
YOUR FATHERS SICKNESS IS A MAIM TO US 
A PERILOUS GASH A VERY LIMB LOPPD OFF

MAY TURN THE TIDE OF FEARFUL FACTION
AND BREED A KIND OF QUESTION IN OUR CAUSE
FOR WELL YOU KNOW WE OF THE OFFERING SIDE
MUST KEEP ALOOF FROM STRICT ARBITREMENT
AND STOP ALL SIGHTHOLES EVERY LOOP FROM WHENCE
THE EYE OF REASON MAY PRY IN UPON US
THIS ABSENCE OF YOUR FATHERS DRAWS A CURTAIN
THAT SHOWS THE IGNORANT A KIND OF FEAR
BEFORE NOT DREAMT OF 
YOU STRAIN TOO FAR 
I RATHER OF HIS ABSENCE MAKE THIS USE
IT LENDS A LUSTRE AND MORE GREAT OPINION
A LARGER DARE TO OUR GREAT ENTERPRISE

WELCOME SIR WALTER BLUNT AND WOULD TO GOD
YOU WERE OF OUR DETERMINATION 
SOME OF US LOVE YOU WELL AND EVEN THOSE SOME
ENVY YOUR GREAT DESERVINGS AND GOOD NAME
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT OF OUR QUALITY
BUT STAND AGAINST US LIKE AN ENEMY 
AND GOD DEFEND BUT STILL I SHOULD STAND SO
SO LONG AS OUT OF LIMIT AND TRUE RULE
YOU STAND AGAINST ANOINTED MAJESTY 
BUT TO MY CHARGE  THE KING HATH SENT TO KNOW
THE NATURE OF YOUR GRIEFS AND WHEREUPON
YOU CONJURE FROM THE BREAST OF CIVIL PEACE
SUCH BOLD HOSTILITY TEACHING HIS DUTEOUS LAND
AUDACIOUS CRUELTY  IF THAT THE KING
HAVE ANY WAY YOUR GOOD DESERTS FORGOT
WHICH HE CONFESSETH TO BE MANIFOLD
HE BIDS YOU NAME YOUR GRIEFS AND WITH ALL SPEED
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR DESIRES WITH INTEREST
AND PARDON ABSOLUTE FOR YOURSELF AND THESE
HEREIN MISLED BY YOUR SUGGESTION 
THE KING IS KIND AND WELL WE KNOW THE KING
KNOWS AT WHAT TIME TO PROMISE WHEN TO PAY 
MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE AND MYSELF
DID GIVE HIM THAT SAME ROYALTY HE WEARS
AND WHEN HE WAS NOT SIX AND TWENTY STRONG
SICK IN THE WORLDS REGARD WRETCHED AND LOW
A POOR UNMINDED OUTLAW SNEAKING HOME
MY FATHER GAVE HIM WELCOME TO THE SHORE
AND WHEN HE HEARD HIM SWEAR AND VOW TO GOD
HE CAME BUT TO BE DUKE OF LANCASTER
TO SUE HIS LIVERY AND BEG HIS PEACE
WITH TEARS OF INNOCENCY AND TERMS OF ZEAL
MY FATHER IN KIND HEART AND PITY MOVED
SWORE HIM ASSISTANCE AND PERFORMD IT TOO 
NOW WHEN THE LORDS AND BARONS OF THE REALM
PERCEIVED NORTHUMBERLAND DID LEAN TO HIM
THE MORE AND LESS CAME IN WITH CAP AND KNEE
MET HIM IN BOROUGHS CITIES VILLAGES
ATTENDED HIM ON BRIDGES STOOD IN LANES
LAID GIFTS BEFORE HIM PROFFERD HIM THEIR OATHS
GAVE HIM THEIR HEIRS AS PAGES FOLLOWD HIM
EVEN AT THE HEELS IN GOLDEN MULTITUDES 
HE PRESENTLY AS GREATNESS KNOWS ITSELF
STEPS ME A LITTLE HIGHER THAN HIS VOW
MADE TO MY FATHER WHILE HIS BLOOD WAS POOR
UPON THE NAKED SHORE AT RAVENSPURGH
AND NOW FORSOOTH TAKES ON HIM TO REFORM
SOME CERTAIN EDICTS AND SOME STRAIT DECREES
THAT LIE TOO HEAVY ON THE COMMONWEALTH
CRIES OUT UPON ABUSES SEEMS TO WEEP
OVER HIS COUNTRYS WRONGS AND BY THIS FACE
THIS SEEMING BROW OF JUSTICE DID HE WIN
THE HEARTS OF ALL THAT HE DID ANGLE FOR
PROCEEDED FURTHER CUT ME OFF THE HEADS
OF ALL THE FAVOURITES THAT THE ABSENT KING
IN DEPUTATION LEFT BEHIND HIM HERE
WHEN HE WAS PERSONAL IN THE IRISH WAR 
TUT I CAME NOT TO HEAR THIS 
THEN TO THE POINT 
IN SHORT TIME AFTER HE DEPOSED THE KING
SOON AFTER THAT DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS LIFE
AND IN THE NECK OF THAT TASKD THE WHOLE STATE
TO MAKE THAT WORSE SUFFERD HIS KINSMAN MARCH
WHO IS IF EVERY OWNER WERE WELL PLACED
INDEED HIS KING TO BE ENGAGED IN WALES
THERE WITHOUT RANSOM TO LIE FORFEITED
DISGRACED ME IN MY HAPPY VICTORIES
SOUGHT TO ENTRAP ME BY INTELLIGENCE
RATED MINE UNCLE FROM THE COUNCILBOARD
IN RAGE DISMISSD MY FATHER FROM THE COURT
BROKE OATH ON OATH COMMITTED WRONG ON WRONG
AND IN CONCLUSION DROVE US TO SEEK OUT
THIS HEAD OF SAFETY AND WITHAL TO PRY
INTO HIS TITLE THE WHICH WE FIND
TOO INDIRECT FOR LONG CONTINUANCE 
SHALL I RETURN THIS ANSWER TO THE KING
NOT SO SIR WALTER WELL WITHDRAW AWHILE 
GO TO THE KING AND LET THERE BE IMPAWND
SOME SURETY FOR A SAFE RETURN AGAIN
AND IN THE MORNING EARLY SHALL MY UNCLE
BRING HIM OUR PURPOSES AND SO FAREWELL 
I WOULD YOU WOULD ACCEPT OF GRACE AND LOVE 
AND MAY BE SO WE SHALL 
PRAY GOD YOU DO 
HIE GOOD SIR MICHAEL BEAR THIS SEALED BRIEF
WITH WINGED HASTE TO THE LORD MARSHAL
THIS TO MY COUSIN SCROOP AND ALL THE REST
TO WHOM THEY ARE DIRECTED  IF YOU KNEW
HOW MUCH THEY DO TO IMPORT YOU WOULD MAKE HASTE 
MY GOOD LORD
I GUESS THEIR TENOR 
LIKE ENOUGH YOU DO 
TOMORROW GOOD SIR MICHAEL IS A DAY
WHEREIN THE FORTUNE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN
MUST BIDE THE TOUCH FOR SIR AT SHREWSBURY
AS I AM TRULY GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
THE KING WITH MIGHTY AND QUICKRAISED POWER
MEETS WITH LORD HARRY AND I FEAR SIR MICHAEL
WHAT WITH THE SICKNESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND
WHOSE POWER WAS IN THE FIRST PROPORTION
AND WHAT WITH OWEN GLENDOWERS ABSENCE THENCE
WHO WITH THEM WAS A RATED SINEW TOO
AND COMES NOT IN OERRULED BY PROPHECIES
I FEAR THE POWER OF PERCY IS TOO WEAK
TO WAGE AN INSTANT TRIAL WITH THE KING 
WHY MY GOOD LORD YOU NEED NOT FEAR
THERE IS DOUGLAS AND LORD MORTIMER 
NO MORTIMER IS NOT THERE 
BUT THERE IS MORDAKE VERNON LORD HARRY PERCY
AND THERE IS MY LORD OF WORCESTER AND A HEAD
OF GALLANT WARRIORS NOBLE GENTLEMEN 
AND SO THERE IS BUT YET THE KING HATH DRAWN
THE SPECIAL HEAD OF ALL THE LAND TOGETHER
THE PRINCE OF WALES LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
THE NOBLE WESTMORELAND AND WARLIKE BLUNT
AND MOE CORRIVALS AND DEAR MEN
OF ESTIMATION AND COMMAND IN ARMS 
DOUBT NOT MY LORD THEY SHALL BE WELL OPPOSED 
I HOPE NO LESS YET NEEDFUL TIS TO FEAR
AND TO PREVENT THE WORST SIR MICHAEL SPEED
FOR IF LORD PERCY THRIVE NOT ERE THE KING
DISMISS HIS POWER HE MEANS TO VISIT US
FOR HE HATH HEARD OF OUR CONFEDERACY
AND TIS BUT WISDOM TO MAKE STRONG AGAINST HIM
THEREFORE MAKE HASTE  I MUST GO WRITE AGAIN
TO OTHER FRIENDS AND SO FAREWELL SIR MICHAEL 
HOW BLOODILY THE SUN BEGINS TO PEER
ABOVE YON BUSKY HILL  THE DAY LOOKS PALE
AT HIS DISTEMPERATURE 
THE SOUTHERN WIND
DOTH PLAY THE TRUMPET TO HIS PURPOSES
AND BY HIS HOLLOW WHISTLING IN THE LEAVES
FORETELLS A TEMPEST AND A BLUSTERING DAY 
THEN WITH THE LOSERS LET IT SYMPATHIZE
FOR NOTHING CAN SEEM FOUL TO THOSE THAT WIN 
HOW NOW MY LORD OF WORCESTER  TIS NOT WELL
THAT YOU AND I SHOULD MEET UPON SUCH TERMS
AS NOW WE MEET  YOU HAVE DECEIVED OUR TRUST
AND MADE US DOFF OUR EASY ROBES OF PEACE
TO CRUSH OUR OLD LIMBS IN UNGENTLE STEEL
THIS IS NOT WELL MY LORD THIS IS NOT WELL 
WHAT SAY YOU TO IT WILL YOU AGAIN UNKNIT
THIS CURLISH KNOT OF ALLABHORRED WAR
AND MOVE IN THAT OBEDIENT ORB AGAIN
WHERE YOU DID GIVE A FAIR AND NATURAL LIGHT
AND BE NO MORE AN EXHALED METEOR
A PRODIGY OF FEAR AND A PORTENT
OF BROACHED MISCHIEF TO THE UNBORN TIMES
HEAR ME MY LIEGE
FOR MINE OWN PART I COULD BE WELL CONTENT
TO ENTERTAIN THE LAGEND OF MY LIFE
WITH QUIET HOURS FOR I DO PROTEST
I HAVE NOT SOUGHT THE DAY OF THIS DISLIKE 
YOU HAVE NOT SOUGHT IT  HOW COMES IT THEN
REBELLION LAY IN HIS WAY AND HE FOUND IT 
PEACE CHEWET PEACE 
IT PLEASED YOUR MAJESTY TO TURN YOUR LOOKS
OF FAVOUR FROM MYSELF AND ALL OUR HOUSE
AND YET I MUST REMEMBER YOU MY LORD
WE WERE THE FIRST AND DEAREST OF YOUR FRIENDS 
FOR YOU MY STAFF OF OFFICE DID I BREAK
IN RICHARDS TIME AND POSTED DAY AND NIGHT
TO MEET YOU ON THE WAY AND KISS YOUR HAND
WHEN YET YOU WERE IN PLACE AND IN ACCOUNT
NOTHING SO STRONG AND FORTUNATE AS I 
IT WAS MYSELF MY BROTHER AND HIS SON
THAT BROUGHT YOU HOME AND BOLDLY DID OUTDARE
THE DANGERS OF THE TIME  YOU SWORE TO US
AND YOU DID SWEAR THAT OATH AT DONCASTER
THAT YOU DID NOTHING PURPOSE GAINST THE STATE
NOR CLAIM NO FURTHER THAN YOUR NEWFALLN RIGHT
THE SEAT OF GAUNT DUKEDOM OF LANCASTER
TO THIS WE SWORE OUR AID  BUT IN SHORT SPACE
IT RAIND DOWN FORTUNE SHOWERING ON YOUR HEAD
AND SUCH A FLOOD OF GREATNESS FELL ON YOU
WHAT WITH OUR HELP WHAT WITH THE ABSENT KING
WHAT WITH THE INJURIES OF A WANTON TIME
THE SEEMING SUFFERANCES THAT YOU HAD BORNE
AND THE CONTRARIOUS WINDS THAT HELD THE KING
SO LONG IN HIS UNLUCKY IRISH WARS
THAT ALL IN ENGLAND DID REPUTE HIM DEAD
AND FROM THIS SWARM OF FAIR ADVANTAGES
YOU TOOK OCCASION TO BE QUICKLY WOOD
TO GRIPE THE GENERAL SWAY INTO YOUR HAND
FORGET YOUR OATH TO US AT DONCASTER
AND BEING FED BY US YOU USED US SO
AS THAT UNGENTLE HULL THE CUCKOOS BIRD
USETH THE SPARROW DID OPPRESS OUR NEST
GREW BY OUR FEEDING TO SO GREAT A BULK
THAT EVEN OUR LOVE DURST NOT COME NEAR YOUR SIGHT
FOR FEAR OF SWALLOWING BUT WITH NIMBLE WING
WE WERE ENFORCED FOR SAFETY SAKE TO FLY
OUT OF SIGHT AND RAISE THIS PRESENT HEAD
WHEREBY WE STAND OPPOSED BY SUCH MEANS
AS YOU YOURSELF HAVE FORGED AGAINST YOURSELF
BY UNKIND USAGE DANGEROUS COUNTENANCE
AND VIOLATION OF ALL FAITH AND TROTH
SWORN TO US IN YOUR YOUNGER ENTERPRISE 
THESE THINGS INDEED YOU HAVE ARTICULATE
PROCLAIMD AT MARKETCROSSES READ IN CHURCHES
TO FACE THE GARMENT OF REBELLION
WITH SOME FINE COLOUR THAT MAY PLEASE THE EYE
OF FICKLE CHANGELINGS AND POOR DISCONTENTS
WHICH GAPE AND RUB THE ELBOW AT THE NEWS
OF HURLYBURLY INNOVATION
AND NEVER YET DID INSURRECTION WANT
SUCH WATERCOLOURS TO IMPAINT HIS CAUSE
NOR MOODY BEGGARS STARVING FOR A TIME
OF PELLMELL HAVOC AND CONFUSION 
IN BOTH YOUR ARMIES THERE IS MANY A SOUL
SHALL PAY FULL DEARLY FOR THIS ENCOUNTER
IF ONCE THEY JOIN IN TRIAL  TELL YOUR NEPHEW
THE PRINCE OF WALES DOTH JOIN WITH ALL THE WORLD
IN PRAISE OF HENRY PERCY BY MY HOPES
THIS PRESENT ENTERPRISE SET OFF HIS HEAD
I DO NOT THINK A BRAVER GENTLEMAN
MORE ACTIVEVALIANT OR MORE VALIANTYOUNG
MORE DARING OR MORE BOLD IS NOW ALIVE
TO GRACE THIS LATTER AGE WITH NOBLE DEEDS 
FOR MY PART I MAY SPEAK IT TO MY SHAME
I HAVE A TRUANT BEEN TO CHIVALRY
AND SO I HEAR HE DOTH ACCOUNT ME TOO
YET THIS BEFORE MY FATHERS MAJESTY 
I AM CONTENT THAT HE SHALL TAKE THE ODDS
OF HIS GREAT NAME AND ESTIMATION

MY NEPHEWS TRESPASS MAY BE WELL FORGOT
IT HATH THE EXCUSE OF YOUTH AND HEAT OF BLOOD
AND AN ADOPTED NAME OF PRIVILEGE
A HAIRBRAIND HOTSPUR GOVERND BY A SPLEEN
ALL HIS OFFENCES LIVE UPON MY HEAD

HE CALLS US REBELS TRAITORS AND WILL SCOURGE
WITH HAUGHTY ARMS THIS HATEFUL NAME IN US 
ARM GENTLEMEN TO ARMS  FOR I HAVE THROWN
A BRAVE DEFIANCE IN KING HENRYS TEETH
AND WESTMORELAND THAT WAS ENGAGED DID BEAR IT

DID HEAR A CHALLENGE URGED MORE MODESTLY
UNLESS A BROTHER SHOULD A BROTHER DARE

TRIMMD UP YOUR PRAISES WITH A PRINCELY TONGUE
SPOKE TO YOUR DESERVINGS LIKE A CHRONICLE
MAKING YOU EVER BETTER THAN HIS PRAISE
BY STILL DISPRAISING PRAISE VALUED IN YOU
AND WHICH BECAME HIM LIKE A PRINCE INDEED
HE MADE A BLUSHING CITAL OF HIMSELF
AND CHID HIS TRUANT YOUTH WITH SUCH A GRACE
AS IF HE MASTERD THERE A DOUBLE SPIRIT 
OF TEACHING AND OF LEARNING INSTANTLY 
THERE DID HE PAUSE BUT LET ME TELL THE WORLD
IF HE OUTLIVE THE ENVY OF THIS DAY
ENGLAND DID NEVER OWE SO SWEET A HOPE
SO MUCH MISCONSTRUED IN HIS WANTONNESS 
COUSIN I THINK THOU ART ENAMOURED
