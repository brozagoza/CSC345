AY ME 
  SHOT BY HEAVEN  PROCEED SWEET CUPID
THOU HAST THUMPED HIM WITH THY BIRDBOLT UNDER THE
LEFT PAP  IN FAITH SECRETS 

SO SWEET A KISS THE GOLDEN SUN GIVES NOT
TO THOSE FRESH MORNING DROPS UPON THE ROSE
AS THY EYEBEAMS WHEN THEIR FRESH RAYS HAVE SMOTE
THE NIGHT OF DEW THAT ON MY CHEEKS DOWN FLOWS
NOR SHINES THE SILVER MOON ONE HALF SO BRIGHT
THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT BOSOM OF THE DEEP
AS DOTH THY FACE THROUGH TEARS OF MINE GIVE LIGHT
THOU SHINEST IN EVERY TEAR THAT I DO WEEP
NO DROP BUT AS A COACH DOTH CARRY THEE
SO RIDEST THOU TRIUMPHING IN MY WOE 
DO BUT BEHOLD THE TEARS THAT SWELL IN ME
AND THEY THY GLORY THROUGH MY GRIEF WILL SHOW
BUT DO NOT LOVE THYSELF THEN THOU WILT KEEP
MY TEARS FOR GLASSES AND STILL MAKE ME WEEP 
O QUEEN OF QUEENS  HOW FAR DOST THOU EXCEL
NO THOUGHT CAN THINK NOR TONGUE OF MORTAL TELL 
HOW SHALL SHE KNOW MY GRIEFS ILL DROP THE PAPER
SWEET LEAVES SHADE FOLLY  WHO IS HE COMES HERE
WHAT LONGAVILLE  AND READING  LISTEN EAR 
NOW IN THY LIKENESS ONE MORE FOOL APPEAR 
AY ME I AM FORSWORN 
WHY HE COMES IN LIKE A PERJURE WEARING PAPERS 
IN LOVE I HOPE SWEET FELLOWSHIP IN SHAME 
ONE DRUNKARD LOVES ANOTHER OF THE NAME 
AM I THE FIRST THAT HAVE BEEN PERJURED SO
I COULD PUT THEE IN COMFORT  NOT BY TWO THAT I KNOW
THOU MAKEST THE TRIUMVIRY THE CORNERCAP OF SOCIETY
THE SHAPE OF LOVES TYBURN THAT HANGS UP SIMPLICITY 
I FEAR THESE STUBBORN LINES LACK POWER TO MOVE
O SWEET MARIA EMPRESS OF MY LOVE 
THESE NUMBERS WILL I TEAR AND WRITE IN PROSE 
O RHYMES ARE GUARDS ON WANTON CUPIDS HOSE
DISFIGURE NOT HIS SLOP 
THIS SAME SHALL GO 
DID NOT THE HEAVENLY RHETORIC OF THINE EYE
GAINST WHOM THE WORLD CANNOT HOLD ARGUMENT
PERSUADE MY HEART TO THIS FALSE PERJURY
VOWS FOR THEE BROKE DESERVE NOT PUNISHMENT 
A WOMAN I FORSWORE BUT I WILL PROVE
THOU BEING A GODDESS I FORSWORE NOT THEE
MY VOW WAS EARTHLY THOU A HEAVENLY LOVE
THY GRACE BEING GAIND CURES ALL DISGRACE IN ME 
VOWS ARE BUT BREATH AND BREATH A VAPOUR IS
THEN THOU FAIR SUN WHICH ON MY EARTH DOST SHINE
EXHALEST THIS VAPOURVOW IN THEE IT IS
IF BROKEN THEN IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE
IF BY ME BROKE WHAT FOOL IS NOT SO WISE
TO LOSE AN OATH TO WIN A PARADISE
THIS IS THE LIVERVEIN WHICH MAKES FLESH A DEITY
A GREEN GOOSE A GODDESS PURE PURE IDOLATRY 
GOD AMEND US GOD AMEND  WE ARE MUCH OUT O THE WAY 
BY WHOM SHALL I SEND THIS COMPANY  STAY 
ALL HID ALL HID AN OLD INFANT PLAY 
LIKE A DEMIGOD HERE SIT I IN THE SKY 
AND WRETCHED FOOLS SECRETS HEEDFULLY OEREYE 
MORE SACKS TO THE MILL  O HEAVENS I HAVE MY WISH 
DUMAIN TRANSFORMD  FOUR WOODCOCKS IN A DISH 
O MOST DIVINE KATE 
O MOST PROFANE COXCOMB 
BY HEAVEN THE WONDER IN A MORTAL EYE 
BY EARTH SHE IS NOT CORPORAL THERE YOU LIE 
HER AMBER HAIR FOR FOUL HATH AMBER QUOTED 
AN AMBERCOLOURD RAVEN WAS WELL NOTED 
AS UPRIGHT AS THE CEDAR 
STOOP I SAY
HER SHOULDER IS WITH CHILD 
AS FAIR AS DAY 
AY AS SOME DAYS BUT THEN NO SUN MUST SHINE 
O THAT I HAD MY WISH 
AND I HAD MINE 
AND I MINE TOO GOOD LORD 
AMEN SO I HAD MINE IS NOT THAT A GOOD WORD
I WOULD FORGET HER BUT A FEVER SHE
REIGNS IN MY BLOOD AND WILL REMEMBERD BE 
A FEVER IN YOUR BLOOD  WHY THEN INCISION
WOULD LET HER OUT IN SAUCERS SWEET MISPRISION 
ONCE MORE ILL READ THE ODE THAT I HAVE WRIT 
ONCE MORE ILL MARK HOW LOVE CAN VARY WIT 

ON A DAY ALACK THE DAY  
LOVE WHOSE MONTH IS EVER MAY
SPIED A BLOSSOM PASSING FAIR
PLAYING IN THE WANTON AIR
THROUGH THE VELVET LEAVES THE WIND
ALL UNSEEN CAN PASSAGE FIND
THAT THE LOVER SICK TO DEATH
WISH HIMSELF THE HEAVENS BREATH 
AIR QUOTH HE THY CHEEKS MAY BLOW
AIR WOULD I MIGHT TRIUMPH SO 
BUT ALACK MY HAND IS SWORN
NEER TO PLUCK THEE FROM THY THORN
VOW ALACK FOR YOUTH UNMEET
YOUTH SO APT TO PLUCK A SWEET 
DO NOT CALL IT SIN IN ME
THAT I AM FORSWORN FOR THEE
THOU FOR WHOM JOVE WOULD SWEAR
JUNO BUT AN ETHIOPE WERE
AND DENY HIMSELF FOR JOVE
TURNING MORTAL FOR THY LOVE 
THIS WILL I SEND AND SOMETHING ELSE MORE PLAIN
THAT SHALL EXPRESS MY TRUE LOVES FASTING PAIN 
O WOULD THE KING BIRON AND LONGAVILLE
WERE LOVERS TOO  ILL TO EXAMPLE ILL
WOULD FROM MY FOREHEAD WIPE A PERJURED NOTE
FOR NONE OFFEND WHERE ALL ALIKE DO DOTE 
  DUMAIN THY LOVE IS FAR FROM CHARITY 
YOU MAY LOOK PALE BUT I SHOULD BLUSH I KNOW
TO BE OERHEARD AND TAKEN NAPPING SO 
  COME SIR YOU BLUSH AS HIS YOUR CASE IS SUCH
YOU CHIDE AT HIM OFFENDING TWICE AS MUCH
YOU DO NOT LOVE MARIA LONGAVILLE
DID NEVER SONNET FOR HER SAKE COMPILE
NOR NEVER LAY HIS WREATHED ARMS ATHWART
HIS LOVING BOSOM TO KEEP DOWN HIS HEART 
I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY SHROUDED IN THIS BUSH
AND MARKD YOU BOTH AND FOR YOU BOTH DID BLUSH
I HEARD YOUR GUILTY RHYMES OBSERVED YOUR FASHION
SAW SIGHS REEK FROM YOU NOTED WELL YOUR PASSION
AY ME  SAYS ONE O JOVE  THE OTHER CRIES
ONE HER HAIRS WERE GOLD CRYSTAL THE OTHERS EYES
YOU WOULD FOR PARADISE BREAK FAITH AND TROTH
AND JOVE FOR YOUR LOVE WOULD INFRINGE AN OATH 
WHAT WILL BIRON SAY WHEN THAT HE SHALL HEAR
FAITH SO INFRINGED WHICH SUCH ZEAL DID SWEAR
HOW WILL HE SCORN  HOW WILL HE SPEND HIS WIT 
HOW WILL HE TRIUMPH LEAP AND LAUGH AT IT 
FOR ALL THE WEALTH THAT EVER I DID SEE
I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM KNOW SO MUCH BY ME 
NOW STEP I FORTH TO WHIP HYPOCRISY 
AH GOOD MY LIEGE I PRAY THEE PARDON ME 
GOOD HEART WHAT GRACE HAST THOU THUS TO REPROVE
THESE WORMS FOR LOVING THAT ART MOST IN LOVE
YOUR EYES DO MAKE NO COACHES IN YOUR TEARS
THERE IS NO CERTAIN PRINCESS THAT APPEARS
YOULL NOT BE PERJURED TIS A HATEFUL THING
TUSH NONE BUT MINSTRELS LIKE OF SONNETING 
BUT ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED NAY ARE YOU NOT
ALL THREE OF YOU TO BE THUS MUCH OERSHOT

BUT I A BEAM DO FIND IN EACH OF THREE 
O WHAT A SCENE OF FOOLERY HAVE I SEEN
OF SIGHS OF GROANS OF SORROW AND OF TEEN 
O ME WITH WHAT STRICT PATIENCE HAVE I SAT
TO SEE A KING TRANSFORMED TO A GNAT 
TO SEE GREAT HERCULES WHIPPING A GIG
AND PROFOUND SOLOMON TO TUNE A JIG
AND NESTOR PLAY AT PUSHPIN WITH THE BOYS
AND CRITIC TIMON LAUGH AT IDLE TOYS 
WHERE LIES THY GRIEF O TELL ME GOOD DUMAIN
AND GENTLE LONGAVILLE WHERE LIES THY PAIN
AND WHERE MY LIEGES ALL ABOUT THE BREAST
A CAUDLE HO 
TOO BITTER IS THY JEST 
ARE WE BETRAYD THUS TO THY OVERVIEW
NOT YOU TO ME BUT I BETRAYD BY YOU
I THAT AM HONEST I THAT HOLD IT SIN
TO BREAK THE VOW I AM ENGAGED IN
I AM BETRAYD BY KEEPING COMPANY
WITH MEN LIKE MEN OF INCONSTANCY 
WHEN SHALL YOU SEE ME WRITE A THING IN RHYME
OR GROAN FOR LOVE OR SPEND A MINUTES TIME
IN PRUNING ME WHEN SHALL YOU HEAR THAT I
WILL PRAISE A HAND A FOOT A FACE AN EYE
A GAIT A STATE A BROW A BREAST A WAIST
A LEG A LIMB
SOFT  WHITHER AWAY SO FAST
A TRUE MAN OR A THIEF THAT GALLOPS SO
I POST FROM LOVE GOOD LOVER LET ME GO 
GOD BLESS THE KING 
WHAT PRESENT HAST THOU THERE
SOME CERTAIN TREASON 
WHAT MAKES TREASON HERE

I BESEECH YOUR GRACE LET THIS LETTER BE READ
OUR PARSON MISDOUBTS IT TWAS TREASON HE SAID 
BIRON READ IT OVER

OF DUN ADRAMADIO DUN ADRAMADIO 
HOW NOW  WHAT IS IN YOU WHY DOST THOU TEAR IT

IT IS BIRONS WRITING AND HERE IS HIS NAME 
  AH YOU WHORESON LOGGERHEAD  YOU WERE
BORN TO DO ME SHAME

ARE PICKPURSES IN LOVE AND WE DESERVE TO DIE 
O DISMISS THIS AUDIENCE AND I SHALL TELL YOU MORE 
NOW THE NUMBER IS EVEN 
TRUE TRUE WE ARE FOUR 
WILL THESE TURTLES BE GONE
HENCE SIRS AWAY 
WALK ASIDE THE TRUE FOLK AND LET THE TRAITORS STAY 
SWEET LORDS SWEET LOVERS O LET US EMBRACE 
AS TRUE WE ARE AS FLESH AND BLOOD CAN BE
THE SEA WILL EBB AND FLOW HEAVEN SHOW HIS FACE
YOUNG BLOOD DOTH NOT OBEY AN OLD DECREE
WE CANNOT CROSS THE CAUSE WHY WE WERE BORN
THEREFORE OF ALL HANDS MUST WE BE FORSWORN 
WHAT DID THESE RENT LINES SHOW SOME LOVE OF THINE
DID THEY QUOTH YOU WHO SEES THE HEAVENLY ROSALINE
THAT LIKE A RUDE AND SAVAGE MAN OF INDE
AT THE FIRST OPENING OF THE GORGEOUS EAST
BOWS NOT HIS VASSAL HEAD AND STRUCKEN BLIND
KISSES THE BASE GROUND WITH OBEDIENT BREAST
WHAT PEREMPTORY EAGLESIGHTED EYE
DARES LOOK UPON THE HEAVEN OF HER BROW
THAT IS NOT BLINDED BY HER MAJESTY
WHAT ZEAL WHAT FURY HATH INSPIRED THEE NOW
MY LOVE HER MISTRESS IS A GRACIOUS MOON
SHE AN ATTENDING STAR SCARCE SEEN A LIGHT 
MY EYES ARE THEN NO EYES NOR I BIRON
O BUT FOR MY LOVE DAY WOULD TURN TO NIGHT 
OF ALL COMPLEXIONS THE CULLD SOVEREIGNTY
DO MEET AS AT A FAIR IN HER FAIR CHEEK
WHERE SEVERAL WORTHIES MAKE ONE DIGNITY
WHERE NOTHING WANTS THAT WANT ITSELF DOTH SEEK 
LEND ME THE FLOURISH OF ALL GENTLE TONGUES 
FIE PAINTED RHETORIC  O SHE NEEDS IT NOT
TO THINGS OF SALE A SELLERS PRAISE BELONGS
SHE PASSES PRAISE THEN PRAISE TOO SHORT DOTH BLOT 
A WITHERD HERMIT FIVESCORE WINTERS WORN
MIGHT SHAKE OFF FIFTY LOOKING IN HER EYE
BEAUTY DOTH VARNISH AGE AS IF NEWBORN
AND GIVES THE CRUTCH THE CRADLES INFANCY
O TIS THE SUN THAT MAKETH ALL THINGS SHINE 
BY HEAVEN THY LOVE IS BLACK AS EBONY 
IS EBONY LIKE HER O WOOD DIVINE 
A WIFE OF SUCH WOOD WERE FELICITY 
O WHO CAN GIVE AN OATH WHERE IS A BOOK
THAT I MAY SWEAR BEAUTY DOTH BEAUTY LACK
IF THAT SHE LEARN NOT OF HER EYE TO LOOK
NO FACE IS FAIR THAT IS NOT FULL SO BLACK 
O PARADOX  BLACK IS THE BADGE OF HELL
THE HUE OF DUNGEONS AND THE SUIT OF NIGHT
AND BEAUTYS CREST BECOMES THE HEAVENS WELL 
DEVILS SOONEST TEMPT RESEMBLING SPIRITS OF LIGHT 
O IF IN BLACK MY LADYS BROWS BE DECKD
IT MOURNS THAT PAINTING AND USURPING HAIR
SHOULD RAVISH DOTERS WITH A FALSE ASPECT
AND THEREFORE IS SHE BORN TO MAKE BLACK FAIR 
HER FAVOUR TURNS THE FASHION OF THE DAYS
FOR NATIVE BLOOD IS COUNTED PAINTING NOW
AND THEREFORE RED THAT WOULD AVOID DISPRAISE
PAINTS ITSELF BLACK TO IMITATE HER BROW 
TO LOOK LIKE HER ARE CHIMNEYSWEEPERS BLACK 
AND SINCE HER TIME ARE COLLIERS COUNTED BRIGHT 
AND ETHIOPES OF THEIR SWEET COMPLEXION CRACK 
DARK NEEDS NO CANDLES NOW FOR DARK IS LIGHT 
YOUR MISTRESSES DARE NEVER COME IN RAIN
FOR FEAR THEIR COLOURS SHOULD BE WASHD AWAY 
TWERE GOOD YOURS DID FOR SIR TO TELL YOU PLAIN
ILL FIND A FAIRER FACE NOT WASHD TODAY 
ILL PROVE HER FAIR OR TALK TILL DOOMSDAY HERE 
NO DEVIL WILL FRIGHT THEE THEN SO MUCH AS SHE 
I NEVER KNEW MAN HOLD VILE STUFF SO DEAR 
LOOK HERES THY LOVE MY FOOT AND HER FACE SEE 
O IF THE STREETS WERE PAVED WITH THINE EYES
HER FEET WERE MUCH TOO DAINTY FOR SUCH TREAD 
O VILE  THEN AS SHE GOES WHAT UPWARD LIES
THE STREET SHOULD SEE AS SHE WALKD OVERHEAD 
BUT WHAT OF THIS ARE WE NOT ALL IN LOVE
NOTHING SO SURE AND THEREBY ALL FORSWORN 
THEN LEAVE THIS CHAT AND GOOD BIRON NOW PROVE
OUR LOVING LAWFUL AND OUR FAITH NOT TORN 
AY MARRY THERE SOME FLATTERY FOR THIS EVIL 
O SOME AUTHORITY HOW TO PROCEED
SOME TRICKS SOME QUILLETS HOW TO CHEAT THE DEVIL 
SOME SALVE FOR PERJURY 
TIS MORE THAN NEED 
HAVE AT YOU THEN AFFECTIONS MEN AT ARMS 
CONSIDER WHAT YOU FIRST DID SWEAR UNTO
TO FAST TO STUDY AND TO SEE NO WOMAN
FLAT TREASON GAINST THE KINGLY STATE OF YOUTH 
SAY CAN YOU FAST YOUR STOMACHS ARE TOO YOUNG
AND ABSTINENCE ENGENDERS MALADIES 
AND WHERE THAT YOU HAVE VOWD TO STUDY LORDS
IN THAT EACH OF YOU HAVE FORSWORN HIS BOOK
CAN YOU STILL DREAM AND PORE AND THEREON LOOK
FOR WHEN WOULD YOU MY LORD OR YOU OR YOU
HAVE FOUND THE GROUND OF STUDYS EXCELLENCE
WITHOUT THE BEAUTY OF A WOMANS FACE
WHY UNIVERSAL PLODDING POISONS UP
THE NIMBLE SPIRITS IN THE ARTERIES
AS MOTION AND LONGDURING ACTION TIRES
THE SINEWY VIGOUR OF THE TRAVELLER 
NOW FOR NOT LOOKING ON A WOMANS FACE
YOU HAVE IN THAT FORSWORN THE USE OF EYES
AND STUDY TOO THE CAUSER OF YOUR VOW
FOR WHERE IS ANY AUTHOR IN THE WORLD
TEACHES SUCH BEAUTY AS A WOMANS EYE
LEARNING IS BUT AN ADJUNCT TO OURSELF
AND WHERE WE ARE OUR LEARNING LIKEWISE IS
THEN WHEN OURSELVES WE SEE IN LADIES EYES
DO WE NOT LIKEWISE SEE OUR LEARNING THERE
O WE HAVE MADE A VOW TO STUDY LORDS
AND IN THAT VOW WE HAVE FORSWORN OUR BOOKS 
FOR WHEN WOULD YOU MY LIEGE OR YOU OR YOU
IN LEADEN CONTEMPLATION HAVE FOUND OUT
SUCH FIERY NUMBERS AS THE PROMPTING EYES
OF BEAUTYS TUTORS HAVE ENRICHD YOU WITH
OTHER SLOW ARTS ENTIRELY KEEP THE BRAIN
AND THEREFORE FINDING BARREN PRACTISERS
SCARCE SHOW A HARVEST OF THEIR HEAVY TOIL
BUT LOVE FIRST LEARNED IN A LADYS EYES
LIVES NOT ALONE IMMURED IN THE BRAIN
BUT WITH THE MOTION OF ALL ELEMENTS
COURSES AS SWIFT AS THOUGHT IN EVERY POWER
AND GIVES TO EVERY POWER A DOUBLE POWER
ABOVE THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THEIR OFFICES 
IT ADDS A PRECIOUS SEEING TO THE EYE
A LOVERS EYES WILL GAZE AN EAGLE BLIND
A LOVERS EAR WILL HEAR THE LOWEST SOUND
WHEN THE SUSPICIOUS HEAD OF THEFT IS STOPPD
LOVES FEELING IS MORE SOFT AND SENSIBLE
THAN ARE THE TENDER HORNS OF COCKLD SNAILS
LOVES TONGUE PROVES DAINTY BACCHUS GROSS IN TASTE
FOR VALOUR IS NOT LOVE A HERCULES
STILL CLIMBING TREES IN THE HESPERIDES
SUBTLE AS SPHINX AS SWEET AND MUSICAL
AS BRIGHT APOLLOS LUTE STRUNG WITH HIS HAIR
AND WHEN LOVE SPEAKS THE VOICE OF ALL THE GODS
MAKES HEAVEN DROWSY WITH THE HARMONY 
NEVER DURST POET TOUCH A PEN TO WRITE
UNTIL HIS INK WERE TEMPERD WITH LOVES SIGHS
O THEN HIS LINES WOULD RAVISH SAVAGE EARS
AND PLANT IN TYRANTS MILD HUMILITY 
FROM WOMENS EYES THIS DOCTRINE I DERIVE
THEY SPARKLE STILL THE RIGHT PROMETHEAN FIRE
THEY ARE THE BOOKS THE ARTS THE ACADEMES
THAT SHOW CONTAIN AND NOURISH ALL THE WORLD
ELSE NONE AT ALL IN OUGHT PROVES EXCELLENT 
THEN FOOLS YOU WERE THESE WOMEN TO FORSWEAR
OR KEEPING WHAT IS SWORN YOU WILL PROVE FOOLS 
FOR WISDOMS SAKE A WORD THAT ALL MEN LOVE
OR FOR LOVES SAKE A WORD THAT LOVES ALL MEN
OR FOR MENS SAKE THE AUTHORS OF THESE WOMEN
OR WOMENS SAKE BY WHOM WE MEN ARE MEN
LET US ONCE LOSE OUR OATHS TO FIND OURSELVES
OR ELSE WE LOSE OURSELVES TO KEEP OUR OATHS 
IT IS RELIGION TO BE THUS FORSWORN
FOR CHARITY ITSELF FULFILLS THE LAW
AND WHO CAN SEVER LOVE FROM CHARITY
SAINT CUPID THEN  AND SOLDIERS TO THE FIELD 
ADVANCE YOUR STANDARDS AND UPON THEM LORDS
PELLMELL DOWN WITH THEM  BUT BE FIRST ADVISED
IN CONFLICT THAT YOU GET THE SUN OF THEM 
NOW TO PLAINDEALING LAY THESE GLOZES BY
SHALL WE RESOLVE TO WOO THESE GIRLS OF FRANCE
AND WIN THEM TOO THEREFORE LET US DEVISE
SOME ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IN THEIR TENTS 
FIRST FROM THE PARK LET US CONDUCT THEM THITHER
THEN HOMEWARD EVERY MAN ATTACH THE HAND
OF HIS FAIR MISTRESS IN THE AFTERNOON
WE WILL WITH SOME STRANGE PASTIME SOLACE THEM
SUCH AS THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME CAN SHAPE
FOR REVELS DANCES MASKS AND MERRY HOURS
FORERUN FAIR LOVE STREWING HER WAY WITH FLOWERS 
AWAY AWAY  NO TIME SHALL BE OMITTED
THAT WILL BETIME AND MAY BY US BE FITTED 
ALLONS  ALLONS  SOWD COCKLE REAPD NO CORN
AND JUSTICE ALWAYS WHIRLS IN EQUAL MEASURE
LIGHT WENCHES MAY PROVE PLAGUES TO MEN FORSWORN
IF SO OUR COPPER BUYS NO BETTER TREASURE 
SATIS QUOD SUFFICIT 
I PRAISE GOD FOR YOU SIR YOUR REASONS AT DINNER

SCURRILITY WITTY WITHOUT AFFECTION AUDACIOUS WITHOUT

WITH THAT THEY ALL DID TUMBLE ON THE GROUND
WITH SUCH A ZEALOUS LAUGHTER SO PROFOUND
THAT IN THIS SPLEEN RIDICULOUS APPEARS
TO CHEQUE THEIR FOLLY PASSIONS SOLEMN TEARS 
BUT WHAT BUT WHAT COME THEY TO VISIT US
THEY DO THEY DO AND ARE APPARELLD THUS 
LIKE MUSCOVITES OR RUSSIANS AS I GUESS 
THEIR PURPOSE IS TO PARLE TO COURT AND DANCE
AND EVERY ONE HIS LOVEFEAT WILL ADVANCE
UNTO HIS SEVERAL MISTRESS WHICH THEYLL KNOW
BY FAVOURS SEVERAL WHICH THEY DID BESTOW 
AND WILL THEY SO THE GALLANTS SHALL BE TASKD
FOR LADIES WE SHALL EVERY ONE BE MASKD
AND NOT A MAN OF THEM SHALL HAVE THE GRACE
DESPITE OF SUIT TO SEE A LADYS FACE 
HOLD ROSALINE THIS FAVOUR THOU SHALT WEAR

UPON THE NEXT OCCASION THAT WE MEET
WITH VISAGES DISPLAYED TO TALK AND GREET 
BUT SHALL WE DANCE IF THEY DESIRE TOT
NO TO THE DEATH WE WILL NOT MOVE A FOOT
NOR TO THEIR PENND SPEECH RENDER WE NO GRACE
BUT WHILE TIS SPOKE EACH TURN AWAY HER FACE 
WHY THAT CONTEMPT WILL KILL THE SPEAKERS HEART
AND QUITE DIVORCE HIS MEMORY FROM HIS PART 
THEREFORE I DO IT AND I MAKE NO DOUBT
THE REST WILL NEER COME IN IF HE BE OUT
THERES NO SUCH SPORT AS SPORT BY SPORT OERTHROWN
TO MAKE THEIRS OURS AND OURS NONE BUT OUR OWN

FROM WHAT IT PURPOSED SINCE TO WAIL FRIENDS LOST
IS NOT BY MUCH SO WHOLESOMEPROFITABLE
AS TO REJOICE AT FRIENDS BUT NEWLY FOUND 
I UNDERSTAND YOU NOT MY GRIEFS ARE DOUBLE 
HONEST PLAIN WORDS BEST PIERCE THE EAR OF GRIEF
AND BY THESE BADGES UNDERSTAND THE KING 
FOR YOUR FAIR SAKES HAVE WE NEGLECTED TIME
PLAYD FOUL PLAY WITH OUR OATHS YOUR BEAUTY LADIES
HATH MUCH DEFORMD US FASHIONING OUR HUMOURS
EVEN TO THE OPPOSED END OF OUR INTENTS
AND WHAT IN US HATH SEEMD RIDICULOUS 
AS LOVE IS FULL OF UNBEFITTING STRAINS
ALL WANTON AS A CHILD SKIPPING AND VAIN
FORMD BY THE EYE AND THEREFORE LIKE THE EYE
FULL OF STRANGE SHAPES OF HABITS AND OF FORMS
VARYING IN SUBJECTS AS THE EYE DOTH ROLL
TO EVERY VARIED OBJECT IN HIS GLANCE
WHICH PARTICOATED PRESENCE OF LOOSE LOVE
PUT ON BY US IF IN YOUR HEAVENLY EYES
HAVE MISBECOMED OUR OATHS AND GRAVITIES
THOSE HEAVENLY EYES THAT LOOK INTO THESE FAULTS
SUGGESTED US TO MAKE  THEREFORE LADIES
OUR LOVE BEING YOURS THE ERROR THAT LOVE MAKES
IS LIKEWISE YOURS WE TO OURSELVES PROVE FALSE
BY BEING ONCE FALSE FOR EVER TO BE TRUE
TO THOSE THAT MAKE US BOTH FAIR LADIES YOU
AND EVEN THAT FALSEHOOD IN ITSELF A SIN
THUS PURIFIES ITSELF AND TURNS TO GRACE 
WE HAVE RECEIVED YOUR LETTERS FULL OF LOVE
YOUR FAVOURS THE AMBASSADORS OF LOVE
AND IN OUR MAIDEN COUNCIL RATED THEM
AT COURTSHIP PLEASANT JEST AND COURTESY
AS BOMBAST AND AS LINING TO THE TIME
BUT MORE DEVOUT THAN THIS IN OUR RESPECTS
HAVE WE NOT BEEN AND THEREFORE MET YOUR LOVES
IN THEIR OWN FASHION LIKE A MERRIMENT 
OUR LETTERS MADAM SHOWD MUCH MORE THAN JEST 
SO DID OUR LOOKS 
WE DID NOT QUOTE THEM SO 
NOW AT THE LATEST MINUTE OF THE HOUR
GRANT US YOUR LOVES 
A TIME METHINKS TOO SHORT
TO MAKE A WORLDWITHOUTEND BARGAIN IN 
NO NO MY LORD YOUR GRACE IS PERJURED MUCH
FULL OF DEAR GUILTINESS AND THEREFORE THIS
IF FOR MY LOVE AS THERE IS NO SUCH CAUSE
YOU WILL DO AUGHT THIS SHALL YOU DO FOR ME
YOUR OATH I WILL NOT TRUST BUT GO WITH SPEED
TO SOME FORLORN AND NAKED HERMITAGE
REMOTE FROM ALL THE PLEASURES OF THE WORLD
THERE STAY UNTIL THE TWELVE CELESTIAL SIGNS
HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THE ANNUAL RECKONING 
IF THIS AUSTERE INSOCIABLE LIFE
CHANGE NOT YOUR OFFER MADE IN HEAT OF BLOOD
IF FROSTS AND FASTS HARD LODGING AND THIN WEEDS
NIP NOT THE GAUDY BLOSSOMS OF YOUR LOVE
BUT THAT IT BEAR THIS TRIAL AND LAST LOVE
THEN AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE YEAR
COME CHALLENGE ME CHALLENGE ME BY THESE DESERTS
AND BY THIS VIRGIN PALM NOW KISSING THINE
I WILL BE THINE AND TILL THAT INSTANT SHUT
MY WOEFUL SELF UP IN A MOURNING HOUSE
RAINING THE TEARS OF LAMENTATION
FOR THE REMEMBRANCE OF MY FATHERS DEATH 
IF THIS THOU DO DENY LET OUR HANDS PART
NEITHER ENTITLED IN THE OTHERS HEART 
IF THIS OR MORE THAN THIS I WOULD DENY
TO FLATTER UP THESE POWERS OF MINE WITH REST
THE SUDDEN HAND OF DEATH CLOSE UP MINE EYE 
HENCE EVER THEN MY HEART IS IN THY BREAST 
AND WHAT TO ME MY LOVE AND WHAT TO ME
YOU MUST BE PURGED TOO YOUR SINS ARE RACKD
YOU ARE ATTAINT WITH FAULTS AND PERJURY
THEREFORE IF YOU MY FAVOUR MEAN TO GET
A TWELVEMONTH SHALL YOU SPEND AND NEVER REST
BUT SEEK THE WEARY BEDS OF PEOPLE SICK 
BUT WHAT TO ME MY LOVE BUT WHAT TO ME A WIFE

IMPOSE SOME SERVICE ON ME FOR THY LOVE 
OFT HAVE I HEARD OF YOU MY LORD BIRON
BEFORE I SAW YOU AND THE WORLDS LARGE TONGUE
PROCLAIMS YOU FOR A MAN REPLETE WITH MOCKS
FULL OF COMPARISONS AND WOUNDING FLOUTS
WHICH YOU ON ALL ESTATES WILL EXECUTE
THAT LIE WITHIN THE MERCY OF YOUR WIT 
TO WEED THIS WORMWOOD FROM YOUR FRUITFUL BRAIN
AND THEREWITHAL TO WIN ME IF YOU PLEASE
WITHOUT THE WHICH I AM NOT TO BE WON
YOU SHALL THIS TWELVEMONTH TERM FROM DAY TO DAY
VISIT THE SPEECHLESS SICK AND STILL CONVERSE
WITH GROANING WRETCHES AND YOUR TASK SHALL BE
WITH ALL THE FIERCE ENDEAVOR OF YOUR WIT
TO ENFORCE THE PAINED IMPOTENT TO SMILE 
TO MOVE WILD LAUGHTER IN THE THROAT OF DEATH
IT CANNOT BE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
MIRTH CANNOT MOVE A SOUL IN AGONY 
WHY THATS THE WAY TO CHOKE A GIBING SPIRIT
WHOSE INFLUENCE IS BEGOT OF THAT LOOSE GRACE
WHICH SHALLOW LAUGHING HEARERS GIVE TO FOOLS
A JESTS PROSPERITY LIES IN THE EAR
OF HIM THAT HEARS IT NEVER IN THE TONGUE
OF HIM THAT MAKES IT THEN IF SICKLY EARS
DEAFD WITH THE CLAMOURS OF THEIR OWN DEAR GROANS
WILL HEAR YOUR IDLE SCORNS CONTINUE THEN
AND I WILL HAVE YOU AND THAT FAULT WITHAL
BUT IF THEY WILL NOT THROW AWAY THAT SPIRIT
AND I SHALL FIND YOU EMPTY OF THAT FAULT
RIGHT JOYFUL OF YOUR REFORMATION 
A TWELVEMONTH  WELL BEFALL WHAT WILL BEFALL
ILL JEST A TWELVEMONTH IN AN HOSPITAL 
  AY SWEET MY LORD AND SO I TAKE MY LEAVE 
NO MADAM WE WILL BRING YOU ON YOUR WAY 
OUR WOOING DOTH NOT END LIKE AN OLD PLAY
JACK HATH NOT JILL THESE LADIES COURTESY
MIGHT WELL HAVE MADE OUR SPORT A COMEDY 
COME SIR IT WANTS A TWELVEMONTH AND A DAY
AND THEN TWILL END 
THATS TOO LONG FOR A PLAY 
SWEET MAJESTY VOUCHSAFE ME 
WAS NOT THAT HECTOR
THE WORTHY KNIGHT OF TROY 
I WILL KISS THY ROYAL FINGER AND TAKE LEAVE  I AM
A VOTARY I HAVE VOWED TO JAQUENETTA TO HOLD THE
PLOUGH FOR HER SWEET LOVE THREE YEARS  BUT MOST
ESTEEMED GREATNESS WILL YOU HEAR THE DIALOGUE THAT
THE TWO LEARNED MEN HAVE COMPILED IN PRAISE OF THE
OWL AND THE CUCKOO IT SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IN THE
END OF OUR SHOW 
CALL THEM FORTH QUICKLY WE WILL DO SO 
HOLLA  APPROACH 
THIS SIDE IS HIEMS WINTER THIS VER THE SPRING
THE ONE MAINTAINED BY THE OWL THE OTHER BY THE
CUCKOO  VER BEGIN 
WHEN DAISIES PIED AND VIOLETS BLUE
AND LADYSMOCKS ALL SILVERWHITE
AND CUCKOOBUDS OF YELLOW HUE
DO PAINT THE MEADOWS WITH DELIGHT
THE CUCKOO THEN ON EVERY TREE
MOCKS MARRIED MEN FOR THUS SINGS HE  CUCKOO
CUCKOO CUCKOO O WORD OF FEAR
UNPLEASING TO A MARRIED EAR 
WHEN SHEPHERDS PIPE ON OATEN STRAWS
AND MERRY LARKS ARE PLOUGHMENS CLOCKS
WHEN TURTLES TREAD AND ROOKS AND DAWS
AND MAIDENS BLEACH THEIR SUMMER SMOCKS
THE CUCKOO THEN ON EVERY TREE
MOCKS MARRIED MEN FOR THUS SINGS HE  CUCKOO
CUCKOO CUCKOO O WORD OF FEAR
UNPLEASING TO A MARRIED EAR 
WHEN ICICLES HANG BY THE WALL
AND DICK THE SHEPHERD BLOWS HIS NAIL
AND TOM BEARS LOGS INTO THE HALL
AND MILK COMES FROZEN HOME IN PAIL
WHEN BLOOD IS NIPPD AND WAYS BE FOUL
THEN NIGHTLY SINGS THE STARING OWL  TUWHIT
TUWHO A MERRY NOTE
WHILE GREASY JOAN DOTH KEEL THE POT 
WHEN ALL ALOUD THE WIND DOTH BLOW
AND COUGHING DROWNS THE PARSONS SAW
AND BIRDS SIT BROODING IN THE SNOW
AND MARIANS NOSE LOOKS RED AND RAW
WHEN ROASTED CRABS HISS IN THE BOWL
THEN NIGHTLY SINGS THE STARING OWL  TUWHIT
TUWHO A MERRY NOTE
WHILE GREASY JOAN DOTH KEEL THE POT 
THE WORDS OF MERCURY ARE HARSH AFTER THE SONGS OF
APOLLO  YOU THAT WAY WE THIS WAY
