NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER BY THIS SUN OF YORK
AND ALL THE CLOUDS THAT LOURD UPON OUR HOUSE
IN THE DEEP BOSOM OF THE OCEAN BURIED 
NOW ARE OUR BROWS BOUND WITH VICTORIOUS WREATHS
OUR BRUISED ARMS HUNG UP FOR MONUMENTS
OUR STERN ALARUMS CHANGED TO MERRY MEETINGS
OUR DREADFUL MARCHES TO DELIGHTFUL MEASURES 
GRIMVISAGED WAR HATH SMOOTHD HIS WRINKLED FRONT
AND NOW INSTEAD OF MOUNTING BARDED STEEDS
TO FRIGHT THE SOULS OF FEARFUL ADVERSARIES
HE CAPERS NIMBLY IN A LADYS CHAMBER
TO THE LASCIVIOUS PLEASING OF A LUTE 
BUT I THAT AM NOT SHAPED FOR SPORTIVE TRICKS
NOR MADE TO COURT AN AMOROUS LOOKINGGLASS
I THAT AM RUDELY STAMPD AND WANT LOVES MAJESTY
TO STRUT BEFORE A WANTON AMBLING NYMPH
I THAT AM CURTAILD OF THIS FAIR PROPORTION
CHEATED OF FEATURE BY DISSEMBLING NATURE
DEFORMED UNFINISHD SENT BEFORE MY TIME
INTO THIS BREATHING WORLD SCARCE HALF MADE UP
AND THAT SO LAMELY AND UNFASHIONABLE
THAT DOGS BARK AT ME AS I HALT BY THEM
WHY I IN THIS WEAK PIPING TIME OF PEACE
HAVE NO DELIGHT TO PASS AWAY THE TIME
UNLESS TO SPY MY SHADOW IN THE SUN
AND DESCANT ON MINE OWN DEFORMITY
AND THEREFORE SINCE I CANNOT PROVE A LOVER
TO ENTERTAIN THESE FAIR WELLSPOKEN DAYS
I AM DETERMINED TO PROVE A VILLAIN
AND HATE THE IDLE PLEASURES OF THESE DAYS 
PLOTS HAVE I LAID INDUCTIONS DANGEROUS
BY DRUNKEN PROPHECIES LIBELS AND DREAMS
TO SET MY BROTHER CLARENCE AND THE KING
IN DEADLY HATE THE ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
AND IF KING EDWARD BE AS TRUE AND JUST
AS I AM SUBTLE FALSE AND TREACHEROUS
THIS DAY SHOULD CLARENCE CLOSELY BE MEWD UP
ABOUT A PROPHECY WHICH SAYS THAT G
OF EDWARDS HEIRS THE MURDERER SHALL BE 
DIVE THOUGHTS DOWN TO MY SOUL HERE
CLARENCE COMES 
BROTHER GOOD DAY WHAT MEANS THIS ARMED GUARD
THAT WAITS UPON YOUR GRACE
HIS MAJESTY
TENDERING MY PERSONS SAFETY HATH APPOINTED
THIS CONDUCT TO CONVEY ME TO THE TOWER 
UPON WHAT CAUSE
BECAUSE MY NAME IS GEORGE 
ALACK MY LORD THAT FAULT IS NONE OF YOURS
HE SHOULD FOR THAT COMMIT YOUR GODFATHERS
O BELIKE HIS MAJESTY HATH SOME INTENT
THAT YOU SHALL BE NEWCHRISTEND IN THE TOWER 
BUT WHATS THE MATTER CLARENCE  MAY I KNOW
YEA RICHARD WHEN I KNOW FOR I PROTEST
AS YET I DO NOT BUT AS I CAN LEARN
HE HEARKENS AFTER PROPHECIES AND DREAMS
AND FROM THE CROSSROW PLUCKS THE LETTER G 
AND SAYS A WIZARD TOLD HIM THAT BY G
HIS ISSUE DISINHERITED SHOULD BE
AND FOR MY NAME OF GEORGE BEGINS WITH G
IT FOLLOWS IN HIS THOUGHT THAT I AM HE 
THESE AS I LEARN AND SUCH LIKE TOYS AS THESE
HAVE MOVED HIS HIGHNESS TO COMMIT ME NOW 
WHY THIS IT IS WHEN MEN ARE RULED BY WOMEN
TIS NOT THE KING THAT SENDS YOU TO THE TOWER
MY LADY GREY HIS WIFE CLARENCE TIS SHE
THAT TEMPERS HIM TO THIS EXTREMITY 
WAS IT NOT SHE AND THAT GOOD MAN OF WORSHIP
ANTHONY WOODVILLE HER BROTHER THERE
THAT MADE HIM SEND LORD HASTINGS TO THE TOWER
FROM WHENCE THIS PRESENT DAY HE IS DELIVERD
WE ARE NOT SAFE CLARENCE WE ARE NOT SAFE 
BY HEAVEN I THINK THERES NO MAN IS SECURE
BUT THE QUEENS KINDRED AND NIGHTWALKING HERALDS
THAT TRUDGE BETWIXT THE KING AND MISTRESS SHORE 
HEARD YE NOT WHAT AN HUMBLE SUPPLIANT
LORD HASTINGS WAS TO HER FOR HIS DELIVERY
HUMBLY COMPLAINING TO HER DEITY
GOT MY LORD CHAMBERLAIN HIS LIBERTY 
ILL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IT IS OUR WAY
IF WE WILL KEEP IN FAVOUR WITH THE KING
TO BE HER MEN AND WEAR HER LIVERY
THE JEALOUS OERWORN WIDOW AND HERSELF
SINCE THAT OUR BROTHER DUBBD THEM GENTLEWOMEN 
ARE MIGHTY GOSSIPS IN THIS MONARCHY 
I BESEECH YOUR GRACES BOTH TO PARDON ME
HIS MAJESTY HATH STRAITLY GIVEN IN CHARGE
THAT NO MAN SHALL HAVE PRIVATE CONFERENCE
OF WHAT DEGREE SOEVER WITH HIS BROTHER 
EVEN SO ANT PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP BRAKENBURY
YOU MAY PARTAKE OF ANY THING WE SAY
WE SPEAK NO TREASON MAN WE SAY THE KING
IS WISE AND VIRTUOUS AND HIS NOBLE QUEEN
WELL STRUCK IN YEARS FAIR AND NOT JEALOUS
WE SAY THAT SHORES WIFE HATH A PRETTY FOOT
A CHERRY LIP A BONNY EYE A PASSING PLEASING TONGUE
AND THAT THE QUEENS KINDRED ARE MADE GENTLEFOLKS
HOW SAY YOU SIR CAN YOU DENY ALL THIS
WITH THIS MY LORD MYSELF HAVE NOUGHT TO DO 
NAUGHT TO DO WITH MISTRESS SHORE  I TELL THEE FELLOW
HE THAT DOTH NAUGHT WITH HER EXCEPTING ONE
WERE BEST HE DO IT SECRETLY ALONE 
WHAT ONE MY LORD
HER HUSBAND KNAVE WOULDST THOU BETRAY ME
I BESEECH YOUR GRACE TO PARDON ME AND WITHAL

WE KNOW THY CHARGE BRAKENBURY AND WILL OBEY 
WE ARE THE QUEENS ABJECTS AND MUST OBEY 
BROTHER FAREWELL I WILL UNTO THE KING

MORE PITY THAT THE EAGLE SHOULD BE MEWD
WHILE KITES AND BUZZARDS PREY AT LIBERTY 
WHAT NEWS ABROAD

THE KING IS SICKLY WEAK AND MELANCHOLY
AND HIS PHYSICIANS FEAR HIM MIGHTILY 
NOW BY SAINT PAUL THIS NEWS IS BAD INDEED 
O HE HATH KEPT AN EVIL DIET LONG
AND OVERMUCH CONSUMED HIS ROYAL PERSON
TIS VERY GRIEVOUS TO BE THOUGHT UPON 
WHAT IS HE IN HIS BED

GO YOU BEFORE AND I WILL FOLLOW YOU 
HE CANNOT LIVE I HOPE AND MUST NOT DIE
TILL GEORGE BE PACKD WITH POSTHORSE UP TO HEAVEN 
ILL IN TO URGE HIS HATRED MORE TO CLARENCE
WITH LIES WELL STEELD WITH WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS
AND IF I FALL NOT IN MY DEEP INTENT
CLARENCE HATH NOT ANOTHER DAY TO LIVE
WHICH DONE GOD TAKE KING EDWARD TO HIS MERCY
AND LEAVE THE WORLD FOR ME TO BUSTLE IN 
FOR THEN ILL MARRY WARWICKS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER 
WHAT THOUGH I KILLD HER HUSBAND AND HER FATHER
THE READIEST WAY TO MAKE THE WENCH AMENDS
IS TO BECOME HER HUSBAND AND HER FATHER
THE WHICH WILL I NOT ALL SO MUCH FOR LOVE
AS FOR ANOTHER SECRET CLOSE INTENT
BY MARRYING HER WHICH I MUST REACH UNTO 
BUT YET I RUN BEFORE MY HORSE TO MARKET
CLARENCE STILL BREATHES EDWARD STILL LIVES AND REIGNS
WHEN THEY ARE GONE THEN MUST I COUNT MY GAINS 
SET DOWN SET DOWN YOUR HONOURABLE LOAD
IF HONOUR MAY BE SHROUDED IN A HEARSE
WHILST I AWHILE OBSEQUIOUSLY LAMENT

STABBD BY THE SELFSAME HAND THAT MADE THESE WOUNDS 
LO IN THESE WINDOWS THAT LET FORTH THY LIFE

CURSED BE THE HAND THAT MADE THESE FATAL HOLES 
CURSED BE THE HEART THAT HAD THE HEART TO DO IT 
CURSED THE BLOOD THAT LET THIS BLOOD FROM HENCE 
MORE DIREFUL HAP BETIDE THAT HATED WRETCH
THAT MAKES US WRETCHED BY THE DEATH OF THEE
THAN I CAN WISH TO ADDERS SPIDERS TOADS
OR ANY CREEPING VENOMD THING THAT LIVES 
IF EVER HE HAVE CHILD ABORTIVE BE IT
PRODIGIOUS AND UNTIMELY BROUGHT TO LIGHT
WHOSE UGLY AND UNNATURAL ASPECT
MAY FRIGHT THE HOPEFUL MOTHER AT THE VIEW
AND THAT BE HEIR TO HIS UNHAPPINESS 
IF EVER HE HAVE WIFE LET HER HE MADE
A MISERABLE BY THE DEATH OF HIM
AS I AM MADE BY MY POOR LORD AND THEE 
COME NOW TOWARDS CHERTSEY WITH YOUR HOLY LOAD
TAKEN FROM PAULS TO BE INTERRED THERE
AND STILL AS YOU ARE WEARY OF THE WEIGHT
REST YOU WHILES I LAMENT KING HENRYS CORSE 
STAY YOU THAT BEAR THE CORSE AND SET IT DOWN 
WHAT BLACK MAGICIAN CONJURES UP THIS FIEND
TO STOP DEVOTED CHARITABLE DEEDS
VILLAINS SET DOWN THE CORSE OR BY SAINT PAUL

MY LORD STAND BACK AND LET THE COFFIN PASS 
UNMANNERD DOG  STAND THOU WHEN I COMMAND

OR BY SAINT PAUL ILL STRIKE THEE TO MY FOOT
AND SPURN UPON THEE BEGGAR FOR THY BOLDNESS 
WHAT DO YOU TREMBLE ARE YOU ALL AFRAID

LADY YOU KNOW NO RULES OF CHARITY
WHICH RENDERS GOOD FOR BAD BLESSINGS FOR CURSES 
VILLAIN THOU KNOWST NO LAW OF GOD NOR MAN
NO BEAST SO FIERCE BUT KNOWS SOME TOUCH OF PITY 
BUT I KNOW NONE AND THEREFORE AM NO BEAST 
O WONDERFUL WHEN DEVILS TELL THE TRUTH 
MORE WONDERFUL WHEN ANGELS ARE SO ANGRY 
VOUCHSAFE DIVINE PERFECTION OF A WOMAN
OF THESE SUPPOSEDEVILS TO GIVE ME LEAVE
BY CIRCUMSTANCE BUT TO ACQUIT MYSELF 
VOUCHSAFE DEFUSED INFECTION OF A MAN
FOR THESE KNOWN EVILS BUT TO GIVE ME LEAVE
BY CIRCUMSTANCE TO CURSE THY CURSED SELF 
FAIRER THAN TONGUE CAN NAME THEE LET ME HAVE
SOME PATIENT LEISURE TO EXCUSE MYSELF 
FOULER THAN HEART CAN THINK THEE THOU CANST MAKE
NO EXCUSE CURRENT BUT TO HANG THYSELF 
BY SUCH DESPAIR I SHOULD ACCUSE MYSELF 
AND BY DESPAIRING SHOULDST THOU STAND EXCUSED
FOR DOING WORTHY VENGEANCE ON THYSELF
WHICH DIDST UNWORTHY SLAUGHTER UPON OTHERS 
SAY THAT I SLEW THEM NOT
WHY THEN THEY ARE NOT DEAD
BUT DEAD THEY ARE AND DEVILISH SLAVE BY THEE 
I DID NOT KILL YOUR HUSBAND 
WHY THEN HE IS ALIVE 
NAY HE IS DEAD AND SLAIN BY EDWARDS HAND 
IN THY FOUL THROAT THOU LIEST QUEEN MARGARET SAW
THY MURDEROUS FALCHION SMOKING IN HIS BLOOD
THE WHICH THOU ONCE DIDST BEND AGAINST HER BREAST
BUT THAT THY BROTHERS BEAT ASIDE THE POINT 
I WAS PROVOKED BY HER SLANDEROUS TONGUE

OF THESE PLANTAGENETS HENRY AND EDWARD
AS BLAMEFUL AS THE EXECUTIONER
THOU ART THE CAUSE AND MOST ACCURSED EFFECT 
YOUR BEAUTY WAS THE CAUSE OF THAT EFFECT
YOUR BEAUTY WHICH DID HAUNT ME IN MY SLEEP
TO UNDERTAKE THE DEATH OF ALL THE WORLD
SO I MIGHT LIVE ONE HOUR IN YOUR SWEET BOSOM 
IF I THOUGHT THAT I TELL THEE HOMICIDE
THESE NAILS SHOULD REND THAT BEAUTY FROM MY CHEEKS 
THESE EYES COULD NEVER ENDURE SWEET BEAUTYS WRECK

BLACK NIGHT OERSHADE THY DAY AND DEATH THY LIFE 
CURSE NOT THYSELF FAIR CREATURE THOU ART BOTH 
I WOULD I WERE TO BE REVENGED ON THEE 
IT IS A QUARREL MOST UNNATURAL

TO BE REVENGED ON HIM THAT SLEW MY HUSBAND 
HE THAT BEREFT THEE LADY OF THY HUSBAND
DID IT TO HELP THEE TO A BETTER HUSBAND 
HIS BETTER DOTH NOT BREATHE UPON THE EARTH 
HE LIVES THAT LOVES THEE BETTER THAN HE COULD

WHERE IS HE

NEVER CAME POISON FROM SO SWEET A PLACE 
NEVER HUNG POISON ON A FOULER TOAD 
OUT OF MY SIGHT  THOU DOST INFECT MY EYES 
THINE EYES SWEET LADY HAVE INFECTED MINE 
WOULD THEY WERE BASILISKS TO STRIKE THEE DEAD 
I WOULD THEY WERE THAT I MIGHT DIE AT ONCE
FOR NOW THEY KILL ME WITH A LIVING DEATH 
THOSE EYES OF THINE FROM MINE HAVE DRAWN SALT TEARS
SHAMED THEIR ASPECT WITH STORE OF CHILDISH DROPS
THESE EYES THAT NEVER SHED REMORSEFUL TEAR
NO WHEN MY FATHER YORK AND EDWARD WEPT
TO HEAR THE PITEOUS MOAN THAT RUTLAND MADE
WHEN BLACKFACED CLIFFORD SHOOK HIS SWORD AT HIM
NOR WHEN THY WARLIKE FATHER LIKE A CHILD
TOLD THE SAD STORY OF MY FATHERS DEATH
AND TWENTY TIMES MADE PAUSE TO SOB AND WEEP
THAT ALL THE STANDERSBY HAD WET THEIR CHEEKS
LIKE TREES BEDASHD WITH RAIN IN THAT SAD TIME
MY MANLY EYES DID SCORN AN HUMBLE TEAR
AND WHAT THESE SORROWS COULD NOT THENCE EXHALE
THY BEAUTY HATH AND MADE THEM BLIND WITH WEEPING 
I NEVER SUED TO FRIEND NOR ENEMY
MY TONGUE COULD NEVER LEARN SWEET SMOOTHING WORD
BUT NOW THY BEAUTY IS PROPOSED MY FEE

TEACH NOT THY LIPS SUCH SCORN FOR THEY WERE MADE
FOR KISSING LADY NOT FOR SUCH CONTEMPT 
IF THY REVENGEFUL HEART CANNOT FORGIVE
LO HERE I LEND THEE THIS SHARPPOINTED SWORD
WHICH IF THOU PLEASE TO HIDE IN THIS TRUE BOSOM 
AND LET THE SOUL FORTH THAT ADORETH THEE

AND HUMBLY BEG THE DEATH UPON MY KNEE 
NAY DO NOT PAUSE FOR I DID KILL KING HENRY
BUT TWAS THY BEAUTY THAT PROVOKED ME 
NAY NOW DISPATCH TWAS I THAT STABBD YOUNG EDWARD
BUT TWAS THY HEAVENLY FACE THAT SET ME ON

ARISE DISSEMBLER THOUGH I WISH THY DEATH
I WILL NOT BE THE EXECUTIONER 
THEN BID ME KILL MYSELF AND I WILL DO IT

TUSH THAT WAS IN THY RAGE
SPEAK IT AGAIN AND EVEN WITH THE WORD
THAT HAND WHICH FOR THY LOVE DID KILL THY LOVE
SHALL FOR THY LOVE KILL A FAR TRUER LOVE
TO BOTH THEIR DEATHS THOU SHALT BE ACCESSARY 
I WOULD I KNEW THY HEART 
TIS FIGURED IN MY TONGUE 
I FEAR ME BOTH ARE FALSE 
THEN NEVER MAN WAS TRUE 
WELL WELL PUT UP YOUR SWORD 
SAY THEN MY PEACE IS MADE 
THAT SHALL YOU KNOW HEREAFTER 
BUT SHALL I LIVE IN HOPE
ALL MEN I HOPE LIVE SO 
VOUCHSAFE TO WEAR THIS RING 
TO TAKE IS NOT TO GIVE

EVEN SO THY BREAST ENCLOSETH MY POOR HEART
WEAR BOTH OF THEM FOR BOTH OF THEM ARE THINE 
AND IF THY POOR DEVOTED SUPPLIANT MAY
BUT BEG ONE FAVOUR AT THY GRACIOUS HAND
THOU DOST CONFIRM HIS HAPPINESS FOR EVER 
WHAT IS IT
THAT IT WOULD PLEASE THEE LEAVE THESE SAD DESIGNS
TO HIM THAT HATH MORE CAUSE TO BE A MOURNER
AND PRESENTLY REPAIR TO CROSBY PLACE
WHERE AFTER I HAVE SOLEMNLY INTERRD

SIRS TAKE UP THE CORSE 
TOWARDS CHERTSEY NOBLE LORD

WITH CURSES IN HER MOUTH TEARS IN HER EYES
THE BLEEDING WITNESS OF HER HATRED BY
HAVING GOD HER CONSCIENCE AND THESE BARS
AGAINST ME
AND I NOTHING TO BACK MY SUIT AT ALL
BUT THE PLAIN DEVIL AND DISSEMBLING LOOKS
AND YET TO WIN HER ALL THE WORLD TO NOTHING 
HA 
HATH SHE FORGOT ALREADY THAT BRAVE PRINCE
EDWARD HER LORD WHOM I SOME THREE MONTHS SINCE
STABBD IN MY ANGRY MOOD AT TEWKSBURY
A SWEETER AND A LOVELIER GENTLEMAN
FRAMED IN THE PRODIGALITY OF NATURE
YOUNG VALIANT WISE AND NO DOUBT RIGHT ROYAL
THE SPACIOUS WORLD CANNOT AGAIN AFFORD
AND WILL SHE YET DEBASE HER EYES ON ME
THAT CROPPD THE GOLDEN PRIME OF THIS SWEET PRINCE
AND MADE HER WIDOW TO A WOFUL BED
ON ME WHOSE ALL NOT EQUALS EDWARDS MOIETY
ON ME THAT HALT AND AM UNSHAPEN THUS
MY DUKEDOM TO A BEGGARLY DENIER
I DO MISTAKE MY PERSON ALL THIS WHILE
UPON MY LIFE SHE FINDS ALTHOUGH I CANNOT
MYSELF TO BE A MARVELLOUS PROPER MAN 
ILL BE AT CHARGES FOR A LOOKINGGLASS
AND ENTERTAIN SOME SCORE OR TWO OF TAILORS
TO STUDY FASHIONS TO ADORN MY BODY
SINCE I AM CREPT IN FAVOUR WITH MYSELF
WILL MAINTAIN IT WITH SOME LITTLE COST 
BUT FIRST ILL TURN YON FELLOW IN HIS GRAVE
AND THEN RETURN LAMENTING TO MY LOVE 
SHINE OUT FAIR SUN TILL I HAVE BOUGHT A GLASS
THAT I MAY SEE MY SHADOW AS I PASS 
HAVE PATIENCE MADAM THERES NO DOUBT HIS MAJESTY
WILL SOON RECOVER HIS ACCUSTOMD HEALTH 
IN THAT YOU BROOK IT IN IT MAKES HIM WORSE
THEREFORE FOR GODS SAKE ENTERTAIN GOOD COMFORT
AND CHEER HIS GRACE WITH QUICK AND MERRY WORDS 
IF HE WERE DEAD WHAT WOULD BETIDE OF ME
NO OTHER HARM BUT LOSS OF SUCH A LORD 
THE LOSS OF SUCH A LORD INCLUDES ALL HARM 
THE HEAVENS HAVE BLESSD YOU WITH A GOODLY SON
TO BE YOUR COMFORTER WHEN HE IS GONE 
OH HE IS YOUNG AND HIS MINORITY
IS PUT UNTO THE TRUST OF RICHARD GLOUCESTER
A MAN THAT LOVES NOT ME NOR NONE OF YOU 
IS IT CONCLUDED THAT HE SHALL BE PROTECTOR
IT IS DETERMINED NOT CONCLUDED YET
BUT SO IT MUST BE IF THE KING MISCARRY 
HERE COME THE LORDS OF BUCKINGHAM AND DERBY 
GOOD TIME OF DAY UNTO YOUR ROYAL GRACE

TO YOUR GOOD PRAYERS WILL SCARCELY SAY AMEN 
YET DERBY NOTWITHSTANDING SHES YOUR WIFE

GOD GRANT HIM HEALTH  DID YOU CONFER WITH HIM
MADAM WE DID HE DESIRES TO MAKE ATONEMENT
BETWIXT THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER AND YOUR BROTHERS
AND BETWIXT THEM AND MY LORD CHAMBERLAIN
AND SENT TO WARN THEM TO HIS ROYAL PRESENCE 
WOULD ALL WERE WELL  BUT THAT WILL NEVER BE
I FEAR OUR HAPPINESS IS AT THE HIGHEST 
THEY DO ME WRONG AND I WILL NOT ENDURE IT
WHO ARE THEY THAT COMPLAIN UNTO THE KING
THAT I FORSOOTH AM STERN AND LOVE THEM NOT
BY HOLY PAUL THEY LOVE HIS GRACE BUT LIGHTLY
THAT FILL HIS EARS WITH SUCH DISSENTIOUS RUMOURS 
BECAUSE I CANNOT FLATTER AND SPEAK FAIR
SMILE IN MENS FACES SMOOTH DECEIVE AND COG
DUCK WITH FRENCH NODS AND APISH COURTESY
I MUST BE HELD A RANCOROUS ENEMY 
CANNOT A PLAIN MAN LIVE AND THINK NO HARM
BUT THUS HIS SIMPLE TRUTH MUST BE ABUSED
BY SILKEN SLY INSINUATING JACKS
TO WHOM IN ALL THIS PRESENCE SPEAKS YOUR GRACE
TO THEE THAT HAST NOR HONESTY NOR GRACE 
WHEN HAVE I INJURED THEE WHEN DONE THEE WRONG
OR THEE OR THEE OR ANY OF YOUR FACTION
A PLAGUE UPON YOU ALL  HIS ROYAL PERSON 
WHOM GOD PRESERVE BETTER THAN YOU WOULD WISH  
CANNOT BE QUIET SCARCE A BREATHINGWHILE
BUT YOU MUST TROUBLE HIM WITH LEWD COMPLAINTS 
BROTHER OF GLOUCESTER YOU MISTAKE THE MATTER 
THE KING OF HIS OWN ROYAL DISPOSITION
AND NOT PROVOKED BY ANY SUITOR ELSE
AIMING BELIKE AT YOUR INTERIOR HATRED
WHICH IN YOUR OUTWARD ACTIONS SHOWS ITSELF
AGAINST MY KINDRED BROTHERS AND MYSELF
MAKES HIM TO SEND THAT THEREBY HE MAY GATHER
THE GROUND OF YOUR ILLWILL AND SO REMOVE IT 
I CANNOT TELL THE WORLD IS GROWN SO BAD
THAT WRENS MAKE PREY WHERE EAGLES DARE NOT PERCH
SINCE EVERY JACK BECAME A GENTLEMAN
THERES MANY A GENTLE PERSON MADE A JACK 
COME COME WE KNOW YOUR MEANING BROTHER
GLOUCESTER

MEANTIME GOD GRANTS THAT WE HAVE NEED OF YOU

BY HIM THAT RAISED ME TO THIS CAREFUL HEIGHT
FROM THAT CONTENTED HAP WHICH I ENJOYD

AGAINST THE DUKE OF CLARENCE BUT HAVE BEEN
AN EARNEST ADVOCATE TO PLEAD FOR HIM

WHY LOOKS YOUR GRACE SO HEAVILY TODAY
O I HAVE PASSD A MISERABLE NIGHT
SO FULL OF UGLY SIGHTS OF GHASTLY DREAMS
THAT AS I AM A CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL MAN
I WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH A NIGHT
THOUGH TWERE TO BUY A WORLD OF HAPPY DAYS
SO FULL OF DISMAL TERROR WAS THE TIME 
WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM I LONG TO HEAR YOU TELL IT 
METHOUGHTS THAT I HAD BROKEN FROM THE TOWER
AND WAS EMBARKD TO CROSS TO BURGUNDY
AND IN MY COMPANY MY BROTHER GLOUCESTER
WHO FROM MY CABIN TEMPTED ME TO WALK
UPON THE HATCHES THENCE WE LOOKED TOWARD ENGLAND
AND CITED UP A THOUSAND FEARFUL TIMES
DURING THE WARS OF YORK AND LANCASTER
THAT HAD BEFALLN US  AS WE PACED ALONG
UPON THE GIDDY FOOTING OF THE HATCHES
METHOUGHT THAT GLOUCESTER STUMBLED AND IN FALLING
STRUCK ME THAT THOUGHT TO STAY HIM OVERBOARD
INTO THE TUMBLING BILLOWS OF THE MAIN 
LORD LORD  METHOUGHT WHAT PAIN IT WAS TO DROWN 
WHAT DREADFUL NOISE OF WATERS IN MINE EARS 
WHAT UGLY SIGHTS OF DEATH WITHIN MINE EYES 
METHOUGHT I SAW A THOUSAND FEARFUL WRECKS
TEN THOUSAND MEN THAT FISHES GNAWD UPON
WEDGES OF GOLD GREAT ANCHORS HEAPS OF PEARL
INESTIMABLE STONES UNVALUED JEWELS
ALL SCATTERD IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
SOME LAY IN DEAD MENS SKULLS AND IN THOSE HOLES
WHERE EYES DID ONCE INHABIT THERE WERE CREPT
AS TWERE IN SCORN OF EYES REFLECTING GEMS
WHICH WOOD THE SLIMY BOTTOM OF THE DEEP
AND MOCKD THE DEAD BONES THAT LAY SCATTERD BY 
HAD YOU SUCH LEISURE IN THE TIME OF DEATH
TO GAZE UPON THE SECRETS OF THE DEEP
METHOUGHT I HAD AND OFTEN DID I STRIVE
TO YIELD THE GHOST BUT STILL THE ENVIOUS FLOOD
KEPT IN MY SOUL AND WOULD NOT LET IT FORTH
TO SEEK THE EMPTY VAST AND WANDERING AIR
BUT SMOTHERD IT WITHIN MY PANTING BULK
WHICH ALMOST BURST TO BELCH IT IN THE SEA 
AWAKED YOU NOT WITH THIS SORE AGONY
O NO MY DREAM WAS LENGTHEND AFTER LIFE
O THEN BEGAN THE TEMPEST TO MY SOUL
WHO PASSD METHOUGHT THE MELANCHOLY FLOOD
WITH THAT GRIM FERRYMAN WHICH POETS WRITE OF
UNTO THE KINGDOM OF PERPETUAL NIGHT 
THE FIRST THAT THERE DID GREET MY STRANGER SOUL
WAS MY GREAT FATHERINLAW RENOWNED WARWICK
WHO CRIED ALOUD WHAT SCOURGE FOR PERJURY
CAN THIS DARK MONARCHY AFFORD FALSE CLARENCE
AND SO HE VANISHD THEN CAME WANDERING BY
A SHADOW LIKE AN ANGEL WITH BRIGHT HAIR
DABBLED IN BLOOD AND HE SQUEAKD OUT ALOUD
CLARENCE IS COME FALSE FLEETING PERJURED CLARENCE
THAT STABBD ME IN THE FIELD BY TEWKSBURY
SEIZE ON HIM FURIES TAKE HIM TO YOUR TORMENTS 
WITH THAT METHOUGHTS A LEGION OF FOUL FIENDS
ENVIROND ME ABOUT AND HOWLED IN MINE EARS
SUCH HIDEOUS CRIES THAT WITH THE VERY NOISE
I TREMBLING WAKED AND FOR A SEASON AFTER
COULD NOT BELIEVE BUT THAT I WAS IN HELL
SUCH TERRIBLE IMPRESSION MADE THE DREAM 
NO MARVEL MY LORD THOUGH IT AFFRIGHTED YOU
I PROMISE I AM AFRAID TO HEAR YOU TELL IT 
O BRAKENBURY I HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS
WHICH NOW BEAR EVIDENCE AGAINST MY SOUL
FOR EDWARDS SAKE AND SEE HOW HE REQUITES ME 
O GOD  IF MY DEEP PRAYERS CANNOT APPEASE THEE

O SPARE MY GUILTLESS WIFE AND MY POOR CHILDREN 
I PRAY THEE GENTLE KEEPER STAY BY ME
MY SOUL IS HEAVY AND I FAIN WOULD SLEEP 
I WILL MY LORD GOD GIVE YOUR GRACE GOOD REST 
SORROW BREAKS SEASONS AND REPOSING HOURS
MAKES THE NIGHT MORNING AND THE NOONTIDE NIGHT 
PRINCES HAVE BUT THEIR TIDES FOR THEIR GLORIES
AN OUTWARD HONOUR FOR AN INWARD TOIL
AND FOR UNFELT IMAGINATION
THEY OFTEN FEEL A WORLD OF RESTLESS CARES
SO THAT BETWIXT THEIR TIDES AND LOW NAMES
THERES NOTHING DIFFERS BUT THE OUTWARD FAME 
HO  WHOS HERE

WHEN HE WAKES  WHY FOOL HE SHALL NEVER WAKE TILL

WHY THEN HE WILL SAY WE STABBED HIM SLEEPING 
THE URGING OF THAT WORD JUDGMENT HATH BRED A KIND
OF REMORSE IN ME 
WHAT ART THOU AFRAID
NOT TO KILL HIM HAVING A WARRANT FOR IT BUT TO BE
DAMNED FOR KILLING HIM FROM WHICH NO WARRANT CAN DEFEND US 
I THOUGHT THOU HADST BEEN RESOLUTE

HOW IF IT COME TO THEE AGAIN
ILL NOT MEDDLE WITH IT IT IS A DANGEROUS THING IT

ACCUSETH HIM HE CANNOT SWEAR BUT IT CHEQUES HIM
HE CANNOT LIE WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS WIFE BUT IT
DETECTS HIM TIS A BLUSHING SHAMEFAST SPIRIT THAT
MUTINIES IN A MANS BOSOM IT FILLS ONE FULL OF
OBSTACLES IT MADE ME ONCE RESTORE A PURSE OF GOLD

SPOKE LIKE A TAIL FELLOW THAT RESPECTS HIS
REPUTATION  COME SHALL WE TO THIS GEAR

WHO TOLD ME HOW THE POOR SOUL DID FORSAKE
THE MIGHTY WARWICK AND DID FIGHT FOR ME
WHO TOLD ME IN THE FIELD BY TEWKSBURY
WHEN OXFORD HAD ME DOWN HE RESCUED ME
AND SAID DEAR BROTHER LIVE AND BE A KING
WHO TOLD ME WHEN WE BOTH LAY IN THE FIELD
FROZEN ALMOST TO DEATH HOW HE DID LAP ME
EVEN IN HIS OWN GARMENTS AND GAVE HIMSELF
ALL THIN AND NAKED TO THE NUMB COLD NIGHT

WHAT MEANS THIS SCENE OF RUDE IMPATIENCE
TO MAKE AN ACT OF TRAGIC VIOLENCE
EDWARD MY LORD YOUR SON OUR KING IS DEAD 
WHY GROW THE BRANCHES NOW THE ROOT IS WITHERD
WHY WITHER NOT THE LEAVES THE SAP BEING GONE
IF YOU WILL LIVE LAMENT IF DIE BE BRIEF
THAT OUR SWIFTWINGED SOULS MAY CATCH THE KINGS

ALL SPRINGS REDUCE THEIR CURRENTS TO MINE EYES
THAT I BEING GOVERND BY THE WATERY MOON
MAY SEND FORTH PLENTEOUS TEARS TO DROWN THE WORLD 
OH FOR MY HUSBAND FOR MY DEAR LORD EDWARD 
OH FOR OUR FATHER FOR OUR DEAR LORD CLARENCE 
ALAS FOR BOTH BOTH MINE EDWARD AND CLARENCE 
WHAT STAY HAD I BUT EDWARD AND HES GONE 
WHAT STAY HAD WE BUT CLARENCE AND HES GONE 
WHAT STAYS HAD I BUT THEY AND THEY ARE GONE 
WAS NEVER WIDOW HAD SO DEAR A LOSS 
WERE NEVER ORPHANS HAD SO DEAR A LOSS

ALAS I AM THE MOTHER OF THESE MOANS 
THEIR WOES ARE PARCELLD MINE ARE GENERAL 
SHE FOR AN EDWARD WEEPS AND SO DO I
I FOR A CLARENCE WEEP SO DOTH NOT SHE
THESE BABES FOR CLARENCE WEEP AND SO DO I
I FOR AN EDWARD WEEP SO DO NOT THEY
ALAS YOU THREE ON ME THREEFOLD DISTRESSD
POUR ALL YOUR TEARS  I AM YOUR SORROWS NURSE
AND I WILL PAMPER IT WITH LAMENTATIONS 
COMFORT DEAR MOTHER GOD IS MUCH DISPLEASED
THAT YOU TAKE WITH UNTHANKFULNESS HIS DOING
IN COMMON WORLDLY THINGS TIS CALLD UNGRATEFUL
WITH DULL UNWILLIGNESS TO REPAY A DEBT
WHICH WITH A BOUNTEOUS HAND WAS KINDLY LENT
MUCH MORE TO BE THUS OPPOSITE WITH HEAVEN
FOR IT REQUIRES THE ROYAL DEBT IT LENT YOU 
MADAM BETHINK YOU LIKE A CAREFUL MOTHER
OF THE YOUNG PRINCE YOUR SON SEND STRAIGHT FOR HIM
LET HIM BE CROWND IN HIM YOUR COMFORT LIVES
DROWN DESPERATE SORROW IN DEAD EDWARDS GRAVE
AND PLANT YOUR JOYS IN LIVING EDWARDS THRONE 
MADAM HAVE COMFORT ALL OF US HAVE CAUSE
TO WAIL THE DIMMING OF OUR SHINING STAR
BUT NONE CAN CURE THEIR HARMS BY WAILING THEM 
MADAM MY MOTHER I DO CRY YOU MERCY
I DID NOT SEE YOUR GRACE HUMBLY ON MY KNEE
I CRAVE YOUR BLESSING 
GOD BLESS THEE AND PUT MEEKNESS IN THY MIND
LOVE CHARITY OBEDIENCE AND TRUE DUTY 
  AMEN AND MAKE ME DIE A GOOD OLD MAN 
THAT IS THE BUTTEND OF A MOTHERS BLESSING
I MARVEL WHY HER GRACE DID LEAVE IT OUT 
YOU CLOUDY PRINCES AND HEARTSORROWING PEERS
THAT BEAR THIS MUTUAL HEAVY LOAD OF MOAN
NOW CHEER EACH OTHER IN EACH OTHERS LOVE
THOUGH WE HAVE SPENT OUR HARVEST OF THIS KING
WE ARE TO REAP THE HARVEST OF HIS SON 
THE BROKEN RANCOUR OF YOUR HIGHSWOLN HEARTS
BUT LATELY SPLINTERD KNIT AND JOIND TOGETHER
MUST GENTLY BE PRESERVED CHERISHD AND KEPT
ME SEEMETH GOOD THAT WITH SOME LITTLE TRAIN
FORTHWITH FROM LUDLOW THE YOUNG PRINCE BE FETCHD
HITHER TO LONDON TO BE CROWND OUR KING 
WHY WITH SOME LITTLE TRAIN MY LORD OF BUCKINGHAM
MARRY MY LORD LEST BY A MULTITUDE
THE NEWHEALD WOUND OF MALICE SHOULD BREAK OUT
WHICH WOULD BE SO MUCH THE MORE DANGEROUS
BY HOW MUCH THE ESTATE IS GREEN AND YET UNGOVERND
WHERE EVERY HORSE BEARS HIS COMMANDING REIN
AND MAY DIRECT HIS COURSE AS PLEASE HIMSELF
AS WELL THE FEAR OF HARM AS HARM APPARENT
IN MY OPINION OUGHT TO BE PREVENTED 
I HOPE THE KING MADE PEACE WITH ALL OF US
AND THE COMPACT IS FIRM AND TRUE IN ME 
AND SO IN ME AND SO I THINK IN ALL
YET SINCE IT IS BUT GREEN IT SHOULD BE PUT
TO NO APPARENT LIKELIHOOD OF BREACH
WHICH HAPLY BY MUCH COMPANY MIGHT BE URGED
THEREFORE I SAY WITH NOBLE BUCKINGHAM
THAT IT IS MEET SO FEW SHOULD FETCH THE PRINCE 
AND SO SAY I 
THEN BE IT SO AND GO WE TO DETERMINE
WHO THEY SHALL BE THAT STRAIGHT SHALL POST TO LUDLOW 
MADAM AND YOU MY MOTHER WILL YOU GO
TO GIVE YOUR CENSURES IN THIS WEIGHTY BUSINESS
WITH ALL OUR HARTS 
MY LORD WHOEVER JOURNEYS TO THE PRINCE
FOR GODS SAKE LET NOT US TWO BE BEHIND
FOR BY THE WAY ILL SORT OCCASION

THEN MASTERS LOOK TO SEE A TROUBLOUS WORLD

WOE TO THE LAND THATS GOVERND BY A CHILD 
IN HIM THERE IS A HOPE OF GOVERNMENT
THAT IN HIS NONAGE COUNCIL UNDER HIM
AND IN HIS FULL AND RIPEND YEARS HIMSELF
NO DOUBT SHALL THEN AND TILL THEN GOVERN WELL 
SO STOOD THE STATE WHEN HENRY THE SIXTH
WAS CROWND IN PARIS BUT AT NINE MONTHS OLD 
STOOD THE STATE SO NO NO GOOD FRIENDS GOD WOT
FOR THEN THIS LAND WAS FAMOUSLY ENRICHD
WITH POLITIC GRAVE COUNSEL THEN THE KING
HAD VIRTUOUS UNCLES TO PROTECT HIS GRACE 
WHY SO HATH THIS BOTH BY THE FATHER AND MOTHER 
BETTER IT WERE THEY ALL CAME BY THE FATHER
OR BY THE FATHER THERE WERE NONE AT ALL
FOR EMULATION NOW WHO SHALL BE NEAREST
WILL TOUCH US ALL TOO NEAR IF GOD PREVENT NOT 
O FULL OF DANGER IS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER 
AND THE QUEENS SONS AND BROTHERS HAUGHT AND PROUD
AND WERE THEY TO BE RULED AND NOT TO RULE
THIS SICKLY LAND MIGHT SOLACE AS BEFORE 
COME COME WE FEAR THE WORST ALL SHALL BE WELL 
WHEN CLOUDS APPEAR WISE MEN PUT ON THEIR CLOAKS
WHEN GREAT LEAVES FALL THE WINTER IS AT HAND
WHEN THE SUN SETS WHO DOTH NOT LOOK FOR NIGHT
UNTIMELY STORMS MAKE MEN EXPECT A DEARTH 
ALL MAY BE WELL BUT IF GOD SORT IT SO
TIS MORE THAN WE DESERVE OR I EXPECT 
TRULY THE SOULS OF MEN ARE FULL OF DREAD
YE CANNOT REASON ALMOST WITH A MAN
THAT LOOKS NOT HEAVILY AND FULL OF FEAR 
BEFORE THE TIMES OF CHANGE STILL IS IT SO
BY A DIVINE INSTINCT MENS MINDS MISTRUST
ENSUING DANGERS AS BY PROOF WE SEE
THE WATERS SWELL BEFORE A BOISTEROUS STORM 
BUT LEAVE IT ALL TO GOD  WHITHER AWAY
MARRY WE WERE SENT FOR TO THE JUSTICES 
AND SO WAS I ILL BEAR YOU COMPANY 
LAST NIGHT I HEAR THEY LAY AT NORTHAMPTON

SO LONG AGROWING AND SO LEISURELY
THAT IF THIS RULE WERE TRUE HE SHOULD BE GRACIOUS 
WHY MADAM SO NO DOUBT HE IS 
I HOPE HE IS BUT YET LET MOTHERS DOUBT 
NOW BY MY TROTH IF I HAD BEEN REMEMBERD
I COULD HAVE GIVEN MY UNCLES GRACE A FLOUT
TO TOUCH HIS GROWTH NEARER THAN HE TOUCHD MINE

THE SUM OF ALL I CAN I HAVE DISCLOSED
WHY OR FOR WHAT THESE NOBLES WERE COMMITTED
IS ALL UNKNOWN TO ME MY GRACIOUS LADY 
AY ME I SEE THE DOWNFALL OF OUR HOUSE 
THE TIGER NOW HATH SEIZED THE GENTLE HIND
INSULTING TYRANNY BEGINS TO JET
UPON THE INNOCENT AND AWELESS THRONE
WELCOME DESTRUCTION DEATH AND MASSACRE 
I SEE AS IN A MAP THE END OF ALL 
ACCURSED AND UNQUIET WRANGLING DAYS
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE MINE EYES BEHELD 
MY HUSBAND LOST HIS LIFE TO GET THE CROWN
AND OFTEN UP AND DOWN MY SONS WERE TOSSD
FOR ME TO JOY AND WEEP THEIR GAIN AND LOSS
AND BEING SEATED AND DOMESTIC BROILS
CLEAN OVERBLOWN THEMSELVES THE CONQUERORS 
MAKE WAR UPON THEMSELVES BLOOD AGAINST BLOOD

AND FRANTIC OUTRAGE END THY DAMNED SPLEEN
OR LET ME DIE TO LOOK ON DEATH NO MORE 
COME COME MY BOY WE WILL TO SANCTUARY 
MADAM FAREWELL 
ILL GO ALONG WITH YOU

AND THITHER BEAR YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR GOODS 
FOR MY PART ILL RESIGN UNTO YOUR GRACE
THE SEAL I KEEP AND SO BETIDE TO ME
AS WELL I TENDER YOU AND ALL OF YOURS 
COME ILL CONDUCT YOU TO THE SANCTUARY 
WELCOME SWEET PRINCE TO LONDON TO YOUR CHAMBER 
WELCOME DEAR COUSIN MY THOUGHTS SOVEREIGN
THE WEARY WAY HATH MADE YOU MELANCHOLY 
NO UNCLE BUT OUR CROSSES ON THE WAY
HAVE MADE IT TEDIOUS WEARISOME AND HEAVY
I WANT MORE UNCLES HERE TO WELCOME ME 
SWEET PRINCE THE UNTAINTED VIRTUE OF YOUR YEARS
HATH NOT YET DIVED INTO THE WORLDS DECEIT
NOR MORE CAN YOU DISTINGUISH OF A MAN
THAN OF HIS OUTWARD SHOW WHICH GOD HE KNOWS
SELDOM OR NEVER JUMPETH WITH THE HEART 
THOSE UNCLES WHICH YOU WANT WERE DANGEROUS
YOUR GRACE ATTENDED TO THEIR SUGARD WORDS
BUT LOOKD NOT ON THE POISON OF THEIR HEARTS 
GOD KEEP YOU FROM THEM AND FROM SUCH FALSE FRIENDS 
GOD KEEP ME FROM FALSE FRIENDS  BUT THEY WERE NONE 
MY LORD THE MAYOR OF LONDON COMES TO GREET YOU 
GOD BLESS YOUR GRACE WITH HEALTH AND HAPPY DAYS 
I THANK YOU GOOD MY LORD AND THANK YOU ALL 
I THOUGHT MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHER YORK
WOULD LONG ERE THIS HAVE MET US ON THE WAY
FIE WHAT A SLUG IS HASTINGS THAT HE COMES NOT
TO TELL US WHETHER THEY WILL COME OR NO 
AND IN GOOD TIME HERE COMES THE SWEATING LORD 
WELCOME MY LORD WHAT WILL OUR MOTHER COME
ON WHAT OCCASION GOD HE KNOWS NOT I
THE QUEEN YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHER YORK
HAVE TAKEN SANCTUARY THE TENDER PRINCE
WOULD FAIN HAVE COME WITH ME TO MEET YOUR GRACE
BUT BY HIS MOTHER WAS PERFORCE WITHHELD 
FIE WHAT AN INDIRECT AND PEEVISH COURSE
IS THIS OF HERS  LORD CARDINAL WILL YOUR GRACE
PERSUADE THE QUEEN TO SEND THE DUKE OF YORK
UNTO HIS PRINCELY BROTHER PRESENTLY
IF SHE DENY LORD HASTINGS GO WITH HIM
AND FROM HER JEALOUS ARMS PLUCK HIM PERFORCE 
MY LORD OF BUCKINGHAM IF MY WEAK ORATORY
CAN FROM HIS MOTHER WIN THE DUKE OF YORK
ANON EXPECT HIM HERE BUT IF SHE BE OBDURATE
TO MILD ENTREATIES GOD IN HEAVEN FORBID
WE SHOULD INFRINGE THE HOLY PRIVILEGE
OF BLESSED SANCTUARY  NOT FOR ALL THIS LAND
WOULD I BE GUILTY OF SO DEEP A SIN 
YOU ARE TOO SENSELESS OBSTINATE MY LORD
TOO CEREMONIOUS AND TRADITIONAL
WEIGH IT BUT WITH THE GROSSNESS OF THIS AGE
YOU BREAK NOT SANCTUARY IN SEIZING HIM 
THE BENEFIT THEREOF IS ALWAYS GRANTED
TO THOSE WHOSE DEALINGS HAVE DESERVED THE PLACE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE THE WIT TO CLAIM THE PLACE
THIS PRINCE HATH NEITHER CLAIMD IT NOR DESERVED IT
AND THEREFORE IN MINE OPINION CANNOT HAVE IT
THEN TAKING HIM FROM THENCE THAT IS NOT THERE
YOU BREAK NO PRIVILEGE NOR CHARTER THERE 
OFT HAVE I HEARD OF SANCTUARY MEN
BUT SANCTUARY CHILDREN NEER TILL NOW 
MY LORD YOU SHALL OERRULE MY MIND FOR ONCE 
COME ON LORD HASTINGS WILL YOU GO WITH ME

GOOD LORDS MAKE ALL THE SPEEDY HASTE YOU MAY 
SAY UNCLE GLOUCESTER IF OUR BROTHER COME

WHERE IT SEEMS BEST UNTO YOUR ROYAL SELF 
IF I MAY COUNSEL YOU SOME DAY OR TWO
YOUR HIGHNESS SHALL REPOSE YOU AT THE TOWER
THEN WHERE YOU PLEASE AND SHALL BE THOUGHT MOST FIT
FOR YOUR BEST HEALTH AND RECREATION 
I DO NOT LIKE THE TOWER OF ANY PLACE 
DID JULIUS CAESAR BUILD THAT PLACE MY LORD
HE DID MY GRACIOUS LORD BEGIN THAT PLACE
WHICH SINCE SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE REEDIFIED 
IS IT UPON RECORD OR ELSE REPORTED
SUCCESSIVELY FROM AGE TO AGE HE BUILT IT
UPON RECORD MY GRACIOUS LORD 
BUT SAY MY LORD IT WERE NOT REGISTERD
METHINKS THE TRUTH SHOULD LIVE FROM AGE TO AGE
AS TWERE RETAILD TO ALL POSTERITY
EVEN TO THE GENERAL ALLENDING DAY 
  SO WISE SO YOUNG THEY SAY DO NEVER
LIVE LONG 
WHAT SAY YOU UNCLE
I SAY WITHOUT CHARACTERS FAME LIVES LONG 
THUS LIKE THE FORMAL VICE INIQUITY
I MORALIZE TWO MEANINGS IN ONE WORD 
THAT JULIUS CAESAR WAS A FAMOUS MAN
WITH WHAT HIS VALOUR DID ENRICH HIS WIT
HIS WIT SET DOWN TO MAKE HIS VALOUR LIVE
DEATH MAKES NO CONQUEST OF THIS CONQUEROR
FOR NOW HE LIVES IN FAME THOUGH NOT IN LIFE 
ILL TELL YOU WHAT MY COUSIN BUCKINGHAM 
WHAT MY GRACIOUS LORD
AN IF I LIVE UNTIL I BE A MAN
ILL WIN OUR ANCIENT RIGHT IN FRANCE AGAIN
OR DIE A SOLDIER AS I LIVED A KING 
  SHORT SUMMERS LIGHTLY HAVE A FORWARD SPRING 
NOW IN GOOD TIME HERE COMES THE DUKE OF YORK 
RICHARD OF YORK  HOW FARES OUR LOVING BROTHER

HE MAY COMMAND ME AS MY SOVEREIGN
BUT YOU HAVE POWER IN ME AS IN A KINSMAN 
I PRAY YOU UNCLE GIVE ME THIS DAGGER 
MY DAGGER LITTLE COUSIN WITH ALL MY HEART 
A BEGGAR BROTHER
OF MY KIND UNCLE THAT I KNOW WILL GIVE
AND BEING BUT A TOY WHICH IS NO GRIEF TO GIVE 
A GREATER GIFT THAN THAT ILL GIVE MY COUSIN 
A GREATER GIFT  O THATS THE SWORD TO IT 
A GENTLE COUSIN WERE IT LIGHT ENOUGH 
O THEN I SEE YOU WILL PART BUT WITH LIGHT GIFTS
IN WEIGHTIER THINGS YOULL SAY A BEGGAR NAY 
IT IS TOO HEAVY FOR YOUR GRACE TO WEAR 
I WEIGH IT LIGHTLY WERE IT HEAVIER 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MY WEAPON LITTLE LORD
I WOULD THAT I MIGHT THANK YOU AS YOU CALL ME 
HOW
LITTLE 
MY LORD OF YORK WILL STILL BE CROSS IN TALK
UNCLE YOUR GRACE KNOWS HOW TO BEAR WITH HIM 
YOU MEAN TO BEAR ME NOT TO BEAR WITH ME
UNCLE MY BROTHER MOCKS BOTH YOU AND ME
BECAUSE THAT I AM LITTLE LIKE AN APE
HE THINKS THAT YOU SHOULD BEAR ME ON YOUR SHOULDERS 
WITH WHAT A SHARPPROVIDED WIT HE REASONS 
TO MITIGATE THE SCORN HE GIVES HIS UNCLE

TOMORROW THEN I JUDGE A HAPPY DAY 
WHO KNOWS THE LORD PROTECTORS MIND HEREIN
WHO IS MOST INWARD WITH THE ROYAL DUKE
YOUR GRACE WE THINK SHOULD SOONEST KNOW HIS MIND 
WHO I MY LORD I WE KNOW EACH OTHERS FACES
BUT FOR OUR HEARTS HE KNOWS NO MORE OF MINE
THAN I OF YOURS
NOR I NO MORE OF HIS THAN YOU OF MINE 
LORD HASTINGS YOU AND HE ARE NEAR IN LOVE 
I THANK HIS GRACE I KNOW HE LOVES ME WELL
BUT FOR HIS PURPOSE IN THE CORONATION 
I HAVE NOT SOUNDED HIM NOR HE DELIVERD

WHERE IS MY LORD PROTECTOR I HAVE SENT FOR THESE
STRAWBERRIES 
HIS GRACE LOOKS CHEERFULLY AND SMOOTH TODAY
THERES SOME CONCEIT OR OTHER LIKES HIM WELL
WHEN HE DOTH BID GOOD MORROW WITH SUCH A SPIRIT 
I THINK THERES NEVER A MAN IN CHRISTENDOM
THAT CAN LESS HIDE HIS LOVE OR HATE THAN HE
FOR BY HIS FACE STRAIGHT SHALL YOU KNOW HIS HEART 
WHAT OF HIS HEART PERCEIVE YOU IN HIS FACE
BY ANY LIKELIHOOD HE SHOWD TODAY
MARRY THAT WITH NO MAN HERE HE IS OFFENDED
FOR WERE HE HE HAD SHOWN IT IN HIS LOOKS 
I PRAY GOD HE BE NOT I SAY 
I PRAY YOU ALL TELL ME WHAT THEY DESERVE
THAT DO CONSPIRE MY DEATH WITH DEVILISH PLOTS
OF DAMNED WITCHCRAFT AND THAT HAVE PREVAILD
UPON MY BODY WITH THEIR HELLISH CHARMS
THE TENDER LOVE I BEAR YOUR GRACE MY LORD
MAKES ME MOST FORWARD IN THIS NOBLE PRESENCE
TO DOOM THE OFFENDERS WHATSOEVER THEY BE
I SAY MY LORD THEY HAVE DESERVED DEATH 
THEN BE YOUR EYES THE WITNESS OF THIS ILL

IS LIKE A BLASTED SAPLING WITHERD UP
AND THIS IS EDWARDS WIFE THAT MONSTROUS WITCH
CONSORTED WITH THAT HARLOT STRUMPET SHORE

IF THEY HAVE DONE THIS THING MY GRACIOUS LORD 
IF I THOU PROTECTOR OF THIS DAMNED STRUMPET 
TELLEST THOU ME OF IFS  THOU ART A TRAITOR
OFF WITH HIS HEAD  NOW BY SAINT PAUL I SWEAR
I WILL NOT DINE UNTIL I SEE THE SAME 
LOVEL AND RATCLIFF LOOK THAT IT BE DONE
THE REST THAT LOVE ME RISE AND FOLLOW ME 
WOE WOE FOR ENGLAND  NOT A WHIT FOR ME
FOR I TOO FOND MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THIS 
STANLEY DID DREAM THE BOAR DID RAZE HIS HELM
BUT I DISDAIND IT AND DID SCORN TO FLY
THREE TIMES TODAY MY FOOTCLOTH HORSE DID STUMBLE
AND STARTLED WHEN HE LOOKD UPON THE TOWER
AS LOATH TO BEAR ME TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE 
O NOW I WANT THE PRIEST THAT SPAKE TO ME
I NOW REPENT I TOLD THE PURSUIVANT
AS TWERE TRIUMPHING AT MINE ENEMIES
HOW THEY AT POMFRET BLOODILY WERE BUTCHERD
AND I MYSELF SECURE IN GRACE AND FAVOUR 
O MARGARET MARGARET NOW THY HEAVY CURSE
IS LIGHTED ON POOR HASTINGS WRETCHED HEAD 
DISPATCH MY LORD THE DUKE WOULD BE AT DINNER
MAKE A SHORT SHRIFT HE LONGS TO SEE YOUR HEAD 
O MOMENTARY GRACE OF MORTAL MEN
WHICH WE MORE HUNT FOR THAN THE GRACE OF GOD 
WHO BUILDS HIS HOPES IN AIR OF YOUR GOOD LOOKS
LIVES LIKE A DRUNKEN SAILOR ON A MAST
READY WITH EVERY NOD TO TUMBLE DOWN
INTO THE FATAL BOWELS OF THE DEEP 
COME COME DISPATCH TIS BOOTLESS TO EXCLAIM 
O BLOODY RICHARD  MISERABLE ENGLAND

MURDER THY BREATH IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORD
AND THEN BEGIN AGAIN AND STOP AGAIN
AS IF THOU WERT DISTRAUGHT AND MAD WITH TERROR
TUT I CAN COUNTERFEIT THE DEEP TRAGEDIAN
SPEAK AND LOOK BACK AND PRY ON EVERY SIDE
TREMBLE AND START AT WAGGING OF A STRAW
INTENDING DEEP SUSPICION GHASTLY LOOKS

AND BOTH ARE READY IN THEIR OFFICES
AT ANY TIME TO GRACE MY STRATAGEMS 
BUT WHAT IS CATESBY GONE

GOD AND OUR INNOCENCY DEFEND AND GUARD US 
BE PATIENT THEY ARE FRIENDS RATCLIFF AND LOVEL 
HERE IS THE HEAD OF THAT IGNOBLE TRAITOR
THE DANGEROUS AND UNSUSPECTED HASTINGS 
SO DEAR I LOVED THE MAN THAT I MUST WEEP 
I TOOK HIM FOR THE PLAINEST HARMLESS CREATURE
THAT BREATHED UPON THIS EARTH A CHRISTIAN
MADE HIM MY BOOK WHEREIN MY SOUL RECORDED
THE HISTORY OF ALL HER SECRET THOUGHTS
SO SMOOTH HE DAUBD HIS VICE WITH SHOW OF VIRTUE
THAT HIS APPARENT OPEN GUILT OMITTED
I MEAN HIS CONVERSATION WITH SHORES WIFE
HE LIVED FROM ALL ATTAINDER OF SUSPECT 
WELL WELL HE WAS THE COVERTST SHELTERD TRAITOR
THAT EVER LIVED 
WOULD YOU IMAGINE OR ALMOST BELIEVE
WERET NOT THAT BY GREAT PRESERVATION
WE LIVE TO TELL IT YOU THE SUBTLE TRAITOR
THIS DAY HAD PLOTTED IN THE COUNCILHOUSE
TO MURDER ME AND MY GOOD LORD OF GLOUCESTER
WHAT HAD HE SO
WHAT THINK YOU WE ARE TURKS OR INFIDELS
OR THAT WE WOULD AGAINST THE FORM OF LAW
PROCEED THUS RASHLY TO THE VILLAINS DEATH
BUT THAT THE EXTREME PERIL OF THE CASE
THE PEACE OF ENGLAND AND OUR PERSONS SAFETY
ENFORCED US TO THIS EXECUTION
NOW FAIR BEFALL YOU  HE DESERVED HIS DEATH
AND YOU MY GOOD LORDS BOTH HAVE WELL PROCEEDED
TO WARN FALSE TRAITORS FROM THE LIKE ATTEMPTS 
I NEVER LOOKD FOR BETTER AT HIS HANDS
AFTER HE ONCE FELL IN WITH MISTRESS SHORE 
YET HAD NOT WE DETERMINED HE SHOULD DIE
UNTIL YOUR LORDSHIP CAME TO SEE HIS DEATH
WHICH NOW THE LOVING HASTE OF THESE OUR FRIENDS
SOMEWHAT AGAINST OUR MEANING HAVE PREVENTED
BECAUSE MY LORD WE WOULD HAVE HAD YOU HEARD
THE TRAITOR SPEAK AND TIMOROUSLY CONFESS
THE MANNER AND THE PURPOSE OF HIS TREASON
THAT YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE SIGNIFIED THE SAME
UNTO THE CITIZENS WHO HAPLY MAY
MISCONSTRUE US IN HIM AND WAIL HIS DEATH 
BUT MY GOOD LORD YOUR GRACES WORD SHALL SERVE
AS WELL AS I HAD SEEN AND HEARD HIM SPEAK
AND DOUBT YOU NOT RIGHT NOBLE PRINCES BOTH
BUT ILL ACQUAINT OUR DUTEOUS CITIZENS
WITH ALL YOUR JUST PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CAUSE 
AND TO THAT END WE WISHD YOUR LORDSHIP HERE
TO AVOID THE CARPING CENSURES OF THE WORLD 
BUT SINCE YOU COME TOO LATE OF OUR INTENTS
YET WITNESS WHAT YOU HEAR WE DID INTEND
AND SO MY GOOD LORD MAYOR WE BID FAREWELL 
GO AFTER AFTER COUSIN BUCKINGHAM 
THE MAYOR TOWARDS GUILDHALL HIES HIM IN ALL POST
THERE AT YOUR MEETST ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME
INFER THE BASTARDY OF EDWARDS CHILDREN
TELL THEM HOW EDWARD PUT TO DEATH A CITIZEN
ONLY FOR SAYING HE WOULD MAKE HIS SON
HEIR TO THE CROWN MEANING INDEED HIS HOUSE
WHICH BY THE SIGN THEREOF WAS TERMED SO 
MOREOVER URGE HIS HATEFUL LUXURY
AND BESTIAL APPETITE IN CHANGE OF LUST
WHICH STRETCHED TO THEIR SERVANTS DAUGHTERS WIVES
EVEN WHERE HIS LUSTFUL EYE OR SAVAGE HEART
WITHOUT CONTROL LISTED TO MAKE HIS PREY 
NAY FOR A NEED THUS FAR COME NEAR MY PERSON
TELL THEM WHEN THAT MY MOTHER WENT WITH CHILD
OF THAT UNSATIATE EDWARD NOBLE YORK
MY PRINCELY FATHER THEN HAD WARS IN FRANCE
AND BY JUST COMPUTATION OF THE TIME
FOUND THAT THE ISSUE WAS NOT HIS BEGOT
WHICH WELL APPEARED IN HIS LINEAMENTS
BEING NOTHING LIKE THE NOBLE DUKE MY FATHER
BUT TOUCH THIS SPARINGLY AS TWERE FAR OFF
BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY LORD MY MOTHER LIVES 
FEAR NOT MY LORD ILL PLAY THE ORATOR

NOW WILL I IN TO TAKE SOME PRIVY ORDER
TO DRAW THE BRATS OF CLARENCE OUT OF SIGHT
AND TO GIVE NOTICE THAT NO MANNER OF PERSON

THIS IS THE INDICTMENT OF THE GOOD LORD HASTINGS
WHICH IN A SET HAND FAIRLY IS ENGROSSD
THAT IT MAY BE THIS DAY READ OVER IN PAULS 
AND MARK HOW WELL THE SEQUEL HANGS TOGETHER
ELEVEN HOURS I SPENT TO WRITE IT OVER
FOR YESTERNIGHT BY CATESBY WAS IT BROUGHT ME
THE PRECEDENT WAS FULL AS LONG ADOING
AND YET WITHIN THESE FIVE HOURS LIVED LORD HASTINGS
UNTAINTED UNEXAMINED FREE AT LIBERTY
HERES A GOOD WORLD THE WHILE  WHY WHOS SO GROSS

YET WHOS SO BLIND BUT SAYS HE SEES IT NOT
BAD IS THE WORLD AND ALL WILL COME TO NOUGHT
WHEN SUCH BAD DEALINGS MUST BE SEEN IN THOUGHT 
HOW NOW MY LORD WHAT SAY THE CITIZENS
NOW BY THE HOLY MOTHER OF OUR LORD
THE CITIZENS ARE MUM AND SPEAK NOT A WORD 
TOUCHD YOU THE BASTARDY OF EDWARDS CHILDREN
I DID WITH HIS CONTRACT WITH LADY LUCY
AND HIS CONTRACT BY DEPUTY IN FRANCE
THE INSATIATE GREEDINESS OF HIS DESIRES
AND HIS ENFORCEMENT OF THE CITY WIVES
HIS TYRANNY FOR TRIFLES HIS OWN BASTARDY
AS BEING GOT YOUR FATHER THEN IN FRANCE
HIS RESEMBLANCE BEING NOT LIKE THE DUKE
WITHAL I DID INFER YOUR LINEAMENTS
BEING THE RIGHT IDEA OF YOUR FATHER
BOTH IN YOUR FORM AND NOBLENESS OF MIND
LAID OPEN ALL YOUR VICTORIES IN SCOTLAND
YOUR DICIPLINE IN WAR WISDOM IN PEACE
YOUR BOUNTY VIRTUE FAIR HUMILITY
INDEED LEFT NOTHING FITTING FOR THE PURPOSE
UNTOUCHD OR SLIGHTLY HANDLED IN DISCOURSE
AND WHEN MINE ORATORY GREW TO AN END
I BID THEM THAT DID LOVE THEIR COUNTRYS GOOD
CRY GOD SAVE RICHARD ENGLANDS ROYAL KING 
AH  AND DID THEY SO
NO SO GOD HELP ME THEY SPAKE NOT A WORD
BUT LIKE DUMB STATUES OR BREATHING STONES
GAZED EACH ON OTHER AND LOOKD DEADLY PALE 
WHICH WHEN I SAW I REPREHENDED THEM
AND ASKD THE MAYOR WHAT MEANT THIS WILFUL SILENCE
HIS ANSWER WAS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT WONT
TO BE SPOKE TO BUT BY THE RECORDER 
THEN HE WAS URGED TO TELL MY TALE AGAIN
THUS SAITH THE DUKE THUS HATH THE DUKE INFERRD
BUT NOTHING SPAKE IN WARRANT FROM HIMSELF 
WHEN HE HAD DONE SOME FOLLOWERS OF MINE OWN
AT THE LOWER END OF THE HALL HURLD UP THEIR CAPS
AND SOME TEN VOICES CRIED GOD SAVE KING RICHARD 
AND THUS I TOOK THE VANTAGE OF THOSE FEW
THANKS GENTLE CITIZENS AND FRIENDS QUOTH I
THIS GENERAL APPLAUSE AND LOVING SHOUT
ARGUES YOUR WISDOMS AND YOUR LOVE TO RICHARD
AND EVEN HERE BRAKE OFF AND CAME AWAY 
WHAT TONGUELESS BLOCKS WERE THEY  WOULD NOT THEY SPEAK
NO BY MY TROTH MY LORD 
WILL NOT THE MAYOR THEN AND HIS BRETHREN COME
THE MAYOR IS HERE AT HAND INTEND SOME FEAR
BE NOT YOU SPOKE WITH BUT BY MIGHTY SUIT
AND LOOK YOU GET A PRAYERBOOK IN YOUR HAND
AND STAND BETWIXT TWO CHURCHMEN GOOD MY LORD
FOR ON THAT GROUND ILL BUILD A HOLY DESCANT
AND BE NOT EASILY WON TO OUR REQUEST
PLAY THE MAIDS PART STILL ANSWER NAY AND TAKE IT 
I GO AND IF YOU PLEAD AS WELL FOR THEM
AS I CAN SAY NAY TO THEE FOR MYSELF
NO DOUBT WELL BRING IT TO A HAPPY ISSUE 
GO GO UP TO THE LEADS THE LORD MAYOR KNOCKS 
WELCOME MY LORD I DANCE ATTENDANCE HERE

HERE COMES HIS SERVANT HOW NOW CATESBY
WHAT SAYS HE
MY LORD HE DOTH ENTREAT YOUR GRACE
TO VISIT HIM TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY
HE IS WITHIN WITH TWO RIGHT REVEREND FATHERS
DIVINELY BENT TO MEDITATION
AND NO WORLDLY SUIT WOULD HE BE MOVED
TO DRAW HIM FROM HIS HOLY EXERCISE 
RETURN GOOD CATESBY TO THY LORD AGAIN
TELL HIM MYSELF THE MAYOR AND CITIZENS
IN DEEP DESIGNS AND MATTERS OF GREAT MOMENT
NO LESS IMPORTING THAN OUR GENERAL GOOD
ARE COME TO HAVE SOME CONFERENCE WITH HIS GRACE 
ILL TELL HIM WHAT YOU SAY MY LORD 
AH HA MY LORD THIS PRINCE IS NOT AN EDWARD 
HE IS NOT LOLLING ON A LEWD DAYBED
BUT ON HIS KNEES AT MEDITATION
NOT DALLYING WITH A BRACE OF COURTEZANS
BUT MEDITATING WITH TWO DEEP DIVINES
NOT SLEEPING TO ENGROSS HIS IDLE BODY
BUT PRAYING TO ENRICH HIS WATCHFUL SOUL
HAPPY WERE ENGLAND WOULD THIS GRACIOUS PRINCE
TAKE ON HIMSELF THE SOVEREIGNTY THEREOF
BUT SURE I FEAR WE SHALL NEER WIN HIM TO IT 
MARRY GOD FORBID HIS GRACE SHOULD SAY US NAY 
I FEAR HE WILL 
HOW NOW CATESBY WHAT SAYS YOUR LORD
MY LORD
HE WONDERS TO WHAT END YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED
SUCH TROOPS OF CITIZENS TO SPEAK WITH HIM
HIS GRACE NOT BEING WARND THEREOF BEFORE
MY LORD HE FEARS YOU MEAN NO GOOD TO HIM 
SORRY I AM MY NOBLE COUSIN SHOULD
SUSPECT ME THAT I MEAN NO GOOD TO HIM
BY HEAVEN I COME IN PERFECT LOVE TO HIM
AND SO ONCE MORE RETURN AND TELL HIS GRACE 
WHEN HOLY AND DEVOUT RELIGIOUS MEN
ARE AT THEIR BEADS TIS HARD TO DRAW THEM THENCE
SO SWEET IS ZEALOUS CONTEMPLATION 
SEE WHERE HE STANDS BETWEEN TWO CLERGYMEN 
TWO PROPS OF VIRTUE FOR A CHRISTIAN PRINCE
TO STAY HIM FROM THE FALL OF VANITY
AND SEE A BOOK OF PRAYER IN HIS HAND
TRUE ORNAMENTS TO KNOW A HOLY MAN 
FAMOUS PLANTAGENET MOST GRACIOUS PRINCE
LEND FAVOURABLE EARS TO OUR REQUEST
AND PARDON US THE INTERRUPTION
OF THY DEVOTION AND RIGHT CHRISTIAN ZEAL 
MY LORD THERE NEEDS NO SUCH APOLOGY
I RATHER DO BESEECH YOU PARDON ME
WHO EARNEST IN THE SERVICE OF MY GOD
NEGLECT THE VISITATION OF MY FRIENDS 
BUT LEAVING THIS WHAT IS YOUR GRACES PLEASURE
EVEN THAT I HOPE WHICH PLEASETH GOD ABOVE
AND ALL GOOD MEN OF THIS UNGOVERND ISLE 
I DO SUSPECT I HAVE DONE SOME OFFENCE
THAT SEEMS DISGRACIOUS IN THE CITYS EYES
AND THAT YOU COME TO REPREHEND MY IGNORANCE 
YOU HAVE MY LORD WOULD IT MIGHT PLEASE YOUR GRACE
AT OUR ENTREATIES TO AMEND THAT FAULT 
ELSE WHEREFORE BREATHE I IN A CHRISTIAN LAND
THEN KNOW IT IS YOUR FAULT THAT YOU RESIGN
THE SUPREME SEAT THE THRONE MAJESTICAL
THE SCEPTERD OFFICE OF YOUR ANCESTORS
YOUR STATE OF FORTUNE AND YOUR DUE OF BIRTH
THE LINEAL GLORY OF YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
TO THE CORRUPTION OF A BLEMISHED STOCK
WHILST IN THE MILDNESS OF YOUR SLEEPY THOUGHTS
WHICH HERE WE WAKEN TO OUR COUNTRYS GOOD
THIS NOBLE ISLE DOTH WANT HER PROPER LIMBS
HER FACE DEFACED WITH SCARS OF INFAMY
HER ROYAL STOCK GRAFT WITH IGNOBLE PLANTS
AND ALMOST SHOULDERD IN THE SWALLOWING GULF
OF BLIND FORGETFULNESS AND DARK OBLIVION 
WHICH TO RECURE WE HEARTILY SOLICIT
YOUR GRACIOUS SELF TO TAKE ON YOU THE CHARGE
AND KINGLY GOVERNMENT OF THIS YOUR LAND
NOT AS PROTECTOR STEWARD SUBSTITUTE
OR LOWLY FACTOR FOR ANOTHERS GAIN
BUT AS SUCCESSIVELY FROM BLOOD TO BLOOD
YOUR RIGHT OF BIRTH YOUR EMPERY YOUR OWN 
FOR THIS CONSORTED WITH THE CITIZENS
YOUR VERY WORSHIPFUL AND LOVING FRIENDS
AND BY THEIR VEHEMENT INSTIGATION
IN THIS JUST SUIT COME I TO MOVE YOUR GRACE 
I KNOW NOT WHETHER TO DEPART IN SILENCE
OR BITTERLY TO SPEAK IN YOUR REPROOF 
BEST FITTETH MY DEGREE OR YOUR CONDITION
IF NOT TO ANSWER YOU MIGHT HAPLY THINK
TONGUETIED AMBITION NOT REPLYING YIELDED
TO BEAR THE GOLDEN YOKE OF SOVEREIGNTY
WHICH FONDLY YOU WOULD HERE IMPOSE ON ME
IF TO REPROVE YOU FOR THIS SUIT OF YOURS
SO SEASOND WITH YOUR FAITHFUL LOVE TO ME 
THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I CHEQUED MY FRIENDS 
THEREFORE TO SPEAK AND TO AVOID THE FIRST
AND THEN IN SPEAKING NOT TO INCUR THE LAST
DEFINITIVELY THUS I ANSWER YOU 
YOUR LOVE DESERVES MY THANKS BUT MY DESERT
UNMERITABLE SHUNS YOUR HIGH REQUEST 
FIRST IF ALL OBSTACLES WERE CUT AWAY
AND THAT MY PATH WERE EVEN TO THE CROWN
AS MY RIPE REVENUE AND DUE BY BIRTH
YET SO MUCH IS MY POVERTY OF SPIRIT
SO MIGHTY AND SO MANY MY DEFECTS
AS I HAD RATHER HIDE ME FROM MY GREATNESS
BEING A BARK TO BROOK NO MIGHTY SEA
THAN IN MY GREATNESS COVET TO BE HID
AND IN THE VAPOUR OF MY GLORY SMOTHERD 
BUT GOD BE THANKD THERES NO NEED OF ME
AND MUCH I NEED TO HELP YOU IF NEED WERE
THE ROYAL TREE HATH LEFT US ROYAL FRUIT
WHICH MELLOWD BY THE STEALING HOURS OF TIME
WILL WELL BECOME THE SEAT OF MAJESTY
AND MAKE NO DOUBT US HAPPY BY HIS REIGN 
ON HIM I LAY WHAT YOU WOULD LAY ON ME
THE RIGHT AND FORTUNE OF HIS HAPPY STARS
WHICH GOD DEFEND THAT I SHOULD WRING FROM HIM 
MY LORD THIS ARGUES CONSCIENCE IN YOUR GRACE
BUT THE RESPECTS THEREOF ARE NICE AND TRIVIAL
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WELL CONSIDERED 
YOU SAY THAT EDWARD IS YOUR BROTHERS SON
SO SAY WE TOO BUT NOT BY EDWARDS WIFE
FOR FIRST HE WAS CONTRACT TO LADY LUCY 
YOUR MOTHER LIVES A WITNESS TO THAT VOW 
AND AFTERWARD BY SUBSTITUTE BETROTHD
TO BONA SISTER TO THE KING OF FRANCE 
THESE BOTH PUT BY A POOR PETITIONER
A CARECRAZED MOTHER OF A MANY CHILDREN
A BEAUTYWANING AND DISTRESSED WIDOW
EVEN IN THE AFTERNOON OF HER BEST DAYS
MADE PRIZE AND PURCHASE OF HIS LUSTFUL EYE
SEDUCED THE PITCH AND HEIGHT OF ALL HIS THOUGHTS
TO BASE DECLENSION AND LOATHED BIGAMY
BY HER IN HIS UNLAWFUL BED HE GOT
THIS EDWARD WHOM OUR MANNERS TERM THE PRINCE 
MORE BITTERLY COULD I EXPOSTULATE
SAVE THAT FOR REVERENCE TO SOME ALIVE
I GIVE A SPARING LIMIT TO MY TONGUE 
THEN GOOD MY LORD TAKE TO YOUR ROYAL SELF
THIS PROFFERD BENEFIT OF DIGNITY
IF NON TO BLESS US AND THE LAND WITHAL
YET TO DRAW FORTH YOUR NOBLE ANCESTRY
FROM THE CORRUPTION OF ABUSING TIMES
UNTO A LINEAL TRUEDERIVED COURSE 
DO GOOD MY LORD YOUR CITIZENS ENTREAT YOU 
REFUSE NOT MIGHTY LORD THIS PROFFERD LOVE 
O MAKE THEM JOYFUL GRANT THEIR LAWFUL SUIT 
ALAS WHY WOULD YOU HEAP THESE CARES ON ME
I AM UNFIT FOR STATE AND MAJESTY
I DO BESEECH YOU TAKE IT NOT AMISS
I CANNOT NOR I WILL NOT YIELD TO YOU 
IF YOU REFUSE IT AS IN LOVE AND ZEAL
LOATH TO DEPOSE THE CHILD YOUR BROTHERS SON
AS WELL WE KNOW YOUR TENDERNESS OF HEART
AND GENTLE KIND EFFEMINATE REMORSE
WHICH WE HAVE NOTED IN YOU TO YOUR KIN
AND EGALLY INDEED TO ALL ESTATES 
YET WHETHER YOU ACCEPT OUR SUIT OR NO
YOUR BROTHERS SON SHALL NEVER REIGN OUR KING
BUT WE WILL PLANT SOME OTHER IN THE THRONE
TO THE DISGRACE AND DOWNFALL OF YOUR HOUSE
AND IN THIS RESOLUTION HERE WE LEAVE YOU  
COME CITIZENS ZOUNDS  ILL ENTREAT NO MORE 
O DO NOT SWEAR MY LORD OF BUCKINGHAM 
CALL THEM AGAIN MY LORD AND ACCEPT THEIR SUIT 
DO GOOD MY LORD LEST ALL THE LAND DO RUE IT 
WOULD YOU ENFORCE ME TO A WORLD OF CARE
WELL CALL THEM AGAIN  I AM NOT MADE OF STONE
BUT PENETRABLE TO YOUR  KIND ENTREATS
ALBEIT AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE AND MY SOUL 
COUSIN OF BUCKINGHAM AND YOU SAGE GRAVE MEN
SINCE YOU WILL BUCKLE FORTUNE ON MY BACK
TO BEAR HER BURTHEN WHETHER I WILL OR NO
I MUST HAVE PATIENCE TO ENDURE THE LOAD
BUT IF BLACK SCANDAL OR FOULFACED REPROACH
ATTEND THE SEQUEL OF YOUR IMPOSITION
YOUR MERE ENFORCEMENT SHALL ACQUITTANCE ME
FROM ALL THE IMPURE BLOTS AND STAINS THEREOF
FOR GOD HE KNOWS AND YOU MAY PARTLY SEE
HOW FAR I AM FROM THE DESIRE THEREOF 
GOD BLESS YOUR GRACE  WE SEE IT AND WILL SAY IT 
IN SAYING SO YOU SHALL BUT SAY THE TRUTH 
THEN I SALUTE YOU WITH THIS KINGLY TITLE
LONG LIVE RICHARD ENGLANDS ROYAL KING 
AMEN

GOD KNOWS IN ANGUISH PAIN AND AGONY 
AND CAME I NOT AT LAST TO COMFORT YOU

VIRTUOUS AND FAIR ROYAL AND GRACIOUS 
AND MUST SHE DIE FOR THIS O LET HER LIVE
AND ILL CORRUPT HER MANNERS STAIN HER BEAUTY
SLANDER MYSELF AS FALSE TO EDWARDS BED
THROW OVER HER THE VEIL OF INFAMY
SO SHE MAY LIVE UNSCARRD OF BLEEDING SLAUGHTER
I WILL CONFESS SHE WAS NOT EDWARDS DAUGHTER 
WRONG NOT HER BIRTH SHE IS OF ROYAL BLOOD 
TO SAVE HER LIFE ILL SAY SHE IS NOT SO 
HER LIFE IS ONLY SAFEST IN HER BIRTH 
AND ONLY IN THAT SAFETY DIED HER BROTHERS 
LO AT THEIR BIRTHS GOOD STARS WERE OPPOSITE 
NO TO THEIR LIVES BAD FRIENDS WERE CONTRARY 
ALL UNAVOIDED IS THE DOOM OF DESTINY 
TRUE WHEN AVOIDED GRACE MAKES DESTINY
MY BABES WERE DESTINED TO A FAIRER DEATH
IF GRACE HAD BLESSD THEE WITH A FAIRER LIFE 
YOU SPEAK AS IF THAT I HAD SLAIN MY COUSINS 
COUSINS INDEED AND BY THEIR UNCLE COZEND
OF COMFORT KINGDOM KINDRED FREEDOM LIFE 
WHOSE HAND SOEVER LANCED THEIR TENDER HEARTS
THY HEAD ALL INDIRECTLY GAVE DIRECTION
NO DOUBT THE MURDEROUS KNIFE WAS DULL AND BLUNT
TILL IT WAS WHETTED ON THY STONEHARD HEART
TO REVEL IN THE ENTRAILS OF MY LAMBS 
BUT THAT STILL USE OF GRIEF MAKES WILD GRIEF TAME
MY TONGUE SHOULD TO THY EARS NOT NAME MY BOYS
TILL THAT MY NAILS WERE ANCHORD IN THINE EYES
AND I IN SUCH A DESPERATE BAY OF DEATH
LIKE A POOR BARK OF SAILS AND TACKLING REFT
RUSH ALL TO PIECES ON THY ROCKY BOSOM 
MADAM SO THRIVE I IN MY ENTERPRISE
AND DANGEROUS SUCCESS OF BLOODY WARS
AS I INTEND MORE GOOD TO YOU AND YOURS
THAN EVER YOU OR YOURS WERE BY ME WRONGD 
WHAT GOOD IS COVERD WITH THE FACE OF HEAVEN
TO BE DISCOVERD THAT CAN DO ME GOOD
THE ADVANCEMENT OF YOUR CHILDREN GENTLE LADY 
UP TO SOME SCAFFOLD THERE TO LOSE THEIR HEADS
NO TO THE DIGNITY AND HEIGHT OF HONOUR
THE HIGH IMPERIAL TYPE OF THIS EARTHS GLORY 
FLATTER MY SORROWS WITH REPORT OF IT
TELL ME WHAT STATE WHAT DIGNITY WHAT HONOUR
CANST THOU DEMISE TO ANY CHILD OF MINE
EVEN ALL I HAVE YEA AND MYSELF AND ALL
WILL I WITHAL ENDOW A CHILD OF THINE

LAST LONGER TELLING THAN THY KINDNESS DATE 
THEN KNOW THAT FROM MY SOUL I LOVE THY DAUGHTER 
MY DAUGHTERS MOTHER THINKS IT WITH HER SOUL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK

AND WILT THOU LEARN OF ME
MADAM WITH ALL MY HEART 
SEND TO HER BY THE MAN THAT SLEW HER BROTHERS
A PAIR OF BLEEDINGHEARTS THEREON ENGRAVE
EDWARD AND YORK THEN HAPLY SHE WILL WEEP
THEREFORE PRESENT TO HER AS SOMETIME MARGARET
DID TO THY FATHER STEEPD IN RUTLANDS BLOOD 
A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SAY TO HER DID DRAIN
THE PURPLE SAP FROM HER SWEET BROTHERS BODY
AND BID HER DRY HER WEEPING EYES THEREWITH 
IF THIS INDUCEMENT FORCE HER NOT TO LOVE
SEND HER A STORY OF THY NOBLE ACTS
TELL HER THOU MADEST AWAY HER UNCLE CLARENCE
HER UNCLE RIVERS YEA AND FOR HER SAKE
MADEST QUICK CONVEYANCE WITH HER GOOD AUNT ANNE 
COME COME YOU MOCK ME THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO WIN OUR DAUGHTER 
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
UNLESS THOU COULDST PUT ON SOME OTHER SHAPE
AND NOT BE RICHARD THAT HATH DONE ALL THIS 
SAY THAT I DID ALL THIS FOR LOVE OF HER 
NAY THEN INDEED SHE CANNOT CHOOSE BUT HATE THEE
HAVING BOUGHT LOVE WITH SUCH A BLOODY SPOIL 
LOOK WHAT IS DONE CANNOT BE NOW AMENDED
MEN SHALL DEAL UNADVISEDLY SOMETIMES
WHICH AFTER HOURS GIVE LEISURE TO REPENT 
IF I DID TAKE THE KINGDOM FROM YOUR SONS
TO MAKE AMENDS ILL GIVE IT TO YOUR DAUGHTER 
IF I HAVE KILLD THE ISSUE OF YOUR WOMB
TO QUICKEN YOUR INCREASE I WILL BEGET
MINE ISSUE OF YOUR BLOOD UPON YOUR DAUGHTER
A GRANDAMS NAME IS LITTLE LESS IN LOVE
THAN IS THE DOTING TITLE OF A MOTHER
THEY ARE AS CHILDREN BUT ONE STEP BELOW
EVEN OF YOUR METTLE OF YOUR VERY BLOOD
OF AN ONE PAIN SAVE FOR A NIGHT OF GROANS
ENDURED OF HER FOR WHOM YOU BID LIKE SORROW 
YOUR CHILDREN WERE VEXATION TO YOUR YOUTH
BUT MINE SHALL BE A COMFORT TO YOUR AGE 
THE LOSS YOU HAVE IS BUT A SON BEING KING
AND BY THAT LOSS YOUR DAUGHTER IS MADE QUEEN 
I CANNOT MAKE YOU WHAT AMENDS I WOULD
THEREFORE ACCEPT SUCH KINDNESS AS I CAN 
DORSET YOUR SON THAT WITH A FEARFUL SOUL
LEADS DISCONTENTED STEPS IN FOREIGN SOIL
THIS FAIR ALLIANCE QUICKLY SHALL CALL HOME
TO HIGH PROMOTIONS AND GREAT DIGNITY
THE KING THAT CALLS YOUR BEAUTEOUS DAUGHTER WIFE 
FAMILIARLY SHALL CALL THY DORSET BROTHER
AGAIN SHALL YOU BE MOTHER TO A KING
AND ALL THE RUINS OF DISTRESSFUL TIMES
REPAIRD WITH DOUBLE RICHES OF CONTENT 
WHAT  WE HAVE MANY GOODLY DAYS TO SEE
THE LIQUID DROPS OF TEARS THAT YOU HAVE SHED
SHALL COME AGAIN TRANSFORMD TO ORIENT PEARL
ADVANTAGING THEIR LOAN WITH INTEREST
OF TEN TIMES DOUBLE GAIN OF HAPPINESS 
GO THEN MY MOTHER TO THY DAUGHTER GO
MAKE BOLD HER BASHFUL YEARS WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE
PREPARE HER EARS TO HEAR A WOOERS TALE
PUT IN HER TENDER HEART THE ASPIRING FLAME
OF GOLDEN SOVEREIGNTY ACQUAINT THE PRINCESS
WITH THE SWEET SILENT HOURS OF MARRIAGE JOYS
AND WHEN THIS ARM OF MINE HATH CHASTISED
THE PETTY REBEL DULLBRAIND BUCKINGHAM
BOUND WITH TRIUMPHANT GARLANDS WILL I COME
AND LEAD THY DAUGHTER TO A CONQUERORS BED
TO WHOM I WILL RETAIL MY CONQUEST WON
AND SHE SHALL BE SOLE VICTRESS CAESARS CAESAR 
WHAT WERE I BEST TO SAY HER FATHERS BROTHER
WOULD BE HER LORD OR SHALL I SAY HER UNCLE
OR HE THAT SLEW HER BROTHERS AND HER UNCLES
UNDER WHAT TITLE SHALL I WOO FOR THEE
THAT GOD THE LAW MY HONOUR AND HER LOVE
CAN MAKE SEEM PLEASING TO HER TENDER YEARS
INFER FAIR ENGLANDS PEACE BY THIS ALLIANCE 
WHICH SHE SHALL PURCHASE WITH STILL LASTING WAR 
SAY THAT THE KING WHICH MAY COMMAND ENTREATS 
THAT AT HER HANDS WHICH THE KINGS KING FORBIDS 
SAY SHE SHALL BE A HIGH AND MIGHTY QUEEN 
TO WAIL THE TIDE AS HER MOTHER DOTH 
SAY I WILL LOVE HER EVERLASTINGLY 
BUT HOW LONG SHALL THAT TITLE EVER LAST
SWEETLY IN FORCE UNTO HER FAIR LIFES END 
BUT HOW LONG FAIRLY SHALL HER SWEET LIE LAST
SO LONG AS HEAVEN AND NATURE LENGTHENS IT 
SO LONG AS HELL AND RICHARD LIKES OF IT 
SAY I HER SOVEREIGN AM HER SUBJECT LOVE 
BUT SHE YOUR SUBJECT LOATHES SUCH SOVEREIGNTY 
BE ELOQUENT IN MY BEHALF TO HER 
AN HONEST TALE SPEEDS BEST BEING PLAINLY TOLD 
THEN IN PLAIN TERMS TELL HER MY LOVING TALE 
PLAIN AND NOT HONEST IS TOO HARSH A STYLE 
YOUR REASONS ARE TOO SHALLOW AND TOO QUICK 
O NO MY REASONS ARE TOO DEEP AND DEAD
TOO DEEP AND DEAD POOR INFANTS IN THEIR GRAVE 
HARP NOT ON THAT STRING MADAM THAT IS PAST 
HARP ON IT STILL SHALL I TILL HEARTSTRINGS BREAK 
NOW BY MY GEORGE MY GARTER AND MY CROWN 
PROFANED DISHONOURD AND THE THIRD USURPD 
I SWEAR

WHY THEN BY GOD 
GODS WRONG IS MOST OF ALL 
IF THOU HADST FEARD TO BREAK AN OATH BY HIM
THE UNITY THE KING THY BROTHER MADE
HAD NOT BEEN BROKEN NOR MY BROTHER SLAIN
IF THOU HADST FEARD TO BREAK AN OATH BY HIM
THE IMPERIAL METAL CIRCLING NOW THY BROW
HAD GRACED THE TENDER TEMPLES OF MY CHILD
AND BOTH THE PRINCES HAD BEEN BREATHING HERE
WHICH NOW TWO TENDER PLAYFELLOWS TO DUST
THY BROKEN FAITH HATH MADE A PREY FOR WORMS 
WHAT CANST THOU SWEAR BY NOW

THAT THOU HAST WRONGED IN THE TIME OERPAST
FOR I MYSELF HAVE MANY TEARS TO WASH
HEREAFTER TIME FOR TIME PAST WRONGD BY THEE 
THE CHILDREN LIVE WHOSE PARENTS THOU HAST
