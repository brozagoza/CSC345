I WONDER HOW THE KING ESCAPED OUR HANDS 
WHILE WE PURSUED THE HORSEMEN OF THE NORTH
HE SLILY STOLE AWAY AND LEFT HIS MEN
WHEREAT THE GREAT LORD OF NORTHUMBERLAND
WHOSE WARLIKE EARS COULD NEVER BROOK RETREAT
CHEERD UP THE DROOPING ARMY AND HIMSELF
LORD CLIFFORD AND LORD STAFFORD ALL ABREAST
CHARGED OUR MAIN BATTLES FRONT AND BREAKING IN
WERE BY THE SWORDS OF COMMON SOLDIERS SLAIN 
LORD STAFFORDS FATHER DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM

ARMD AS WE ARE LETS STAY WITHIN THIS HOUSE 
THE BLOODY PARLIAMENT SHALL THIS BE CALLD
UNLESS PLANTAGENET DUKE OF YORK BE KING

THE DUKE IS MADE PROTECTOR OF THE REALM
AND YET SHALT THOU BE SAFE SUCH SAFETY FINDS
THE TREMBLING LAMB ENVIRONED WITH WOLVES 
HAD I BEEN THERE WHICH AM A SILLY WOMAN
THE SOLDIERS SHOULD HAVE TOSSD ME ON THEIR PIKES

NO GOD FORBID YOUR GRACE SHOULD BE FORSWORN 
I SHALL BE IF I CLAIM BY OPEN WAR 
ILL PROVE THE CONTRARY IF YOULL HEAR ME SPEAK 
THOU CANST NOT SON IT IS IMPOSSIBLE 
AN OATH IS OF NO MOMENT BEING NOT TOOK
BEFORE A TRUE AND LAWFUL MAGISTRATE
THAT HATH AUTHORITY OVER HIM THAT SWEARS
HENRY HAD NONE BUT DID USURP THE PLACE
THEN SEEING TWAS HE THAT MADE YOU TO DEPOSE
YOUR OATH MY LORD IS VAIN AND FRIVOLOUS 
THEREFORE TO ARMS  AND FATHER DO BUT THINK
HOW SWEET A THING IT IS TO WEAR A CROWN
WITHIN WHOSE CIRCUIT IS ELYSIUM
AND ALL THAT POETS FEIGN OF BLISS AND JOY 
WHY DO WE FINGER THUS I CANNOT REST
UNTIL THE WHITE ROSE THAT I WEAR BE DYED
EVEN IN THE LUKEWARM BLOOD OF HENRYS HEART 
RICHARD ENOUGH I WILL BE KING OR DIE 
BROTHER THOU SHALT TO LONDON PRESENTLY

WHOSE FATHER SLEW MY FATHER HE SHALL DIE 
AND I MY LORD WILL BEAR HIM COMPANY 
SOLDIERS AWAY WITH HIM 
AH CLIFFORD MURDER NOT THIS INNOCENT CHILD
LEST THOU BE HATED BOTH OF GOD AND MAN 
HOW NOW  IS HE DEAD ALREADY OR IS IT FEAR

AND SO HE WALKS INSULTING OER HIS PREY
AND SO HE COMES TO REND HIS LIMBS ASUNDER 
AH GENTLE CLIFFORD KILL ME WITH THY SWORD

NO IF I DIGGD UP THY FOREFATHERS GRAVES
AND HUNG THEIR ROTTEN COFFINS UP IN CHAINS
IT COULD NOT SLAKE MINE IRE NOR EASE MY HEART 
THE SIGHT OF ANY OF THE HOUSE OF YORK

AND TILL I ROOT OUT THEIR ACCURSED LINE
AND LEAVE NOT ONE ALIVE I LIVE IN HELL 
THEREFORE 
O LET ME PRAY BEFORE I TAKE MY DEATH

 KING HENRY VI
THE ARMY OF THE QUEEN HATH GOT THE FIELD
MY UNCLES BOTH ARE SLAIN IN RESCUING ME
AND ALL MY FOLLOWERS TO THE EAGER FOE
TURN BACK AND FLY LIKE SHIPS BEFORE THE WIND
OR LAMBS PURSUED BY HUNGERSTARVED WOLVES 
MY SONS GOD KNOWS WHAT HATH BECHANCED THEM
BUT THIS I KNOW THEY HAVE DEMEAND THEMSELVES
LIKE MEN BORN TO RENOWN BY LIFE OR DEATH 
THREE TIMES DID RICHARD MAKE A LANE TO ME 
AND THRICE CRIED COURAGE FATHER  FIGHT IT OUT 
AND FULL AS OFT CAME EDWARD TO MY SIDE
WITH PURPLE FALCHION PAINTED TO THE HILT
IN BLOOD OF THOSE THAT HAD ENCOUNTERD HIM
AND WHEN THE HARDIEST WARRIORS DID RETIRE
RICHARD CRIED CHARGE  AND GIVE NO FOOT OF GROUND 
AND CRIED A CROWN OR ELSE A GLORIOUS TOMB 
A SCEPTRE OR AN EARTHLY SEPULCHRE 
WITH THIS WE CHARGED AGAIN BUT OUT ALAS 
WE BODGED AGAIN AS I HAVE SEEN A SWAN
WITH BOOTLESS LABOUR SWIM AGAINST THE TIDE
AND SPEND HER STRENGTH WITH OVERMATCHING WAVES 
AH HARK  THE FATAL FOLLOWERS DO PURSUE
AND I AM FAINT AND CANNOT FLY THEIR FURY
AND WERE I STRONG I WOULD NOT SHUN THEIR FURY
THE SANDS ARE NUMBERD THAT MAKE UP MY LIFE
HERE MUST I STAY AND HERE MY LIFE MUST END 
COME BLOODY CLIFFORD ROUGH NORTHUMBERLAND
I DARE YOUR QUENCHLESS FURY TO MORE RAGE
I AM YOUR BUTT AND I ABIDE YOUR SHOT 
YIELD TO OUR MERCY PROUD PLANTAGENET 
AY TO SUCH MERCY AS HIS RUTHLESS ARM
WITH DOWNRIGHT PAYMENT SHOWD UNTO MY FATHER 
NOW PHAETHON HATH TUMBLED FROM HIS CAR
AND MADE AN EVENING AT THE NOONTIDE PRICK 
MY ASHES AS THE PHOENIX MAY BRING FORTH
A BIRD THAT WILL REVENGE UPON YOU ALL
AND IN THAT HOPE I THROW MINE EYES TO HEAVEN
SCORNING WHATEER YOU CAN AFFLICT ME WITH 
WHY COME YOU NOT WHAT  MULTITUDES AND FEAR
SO COWARDS FIGHT WHEN THEY CAN FLY NO FURTHER
SO DOVES DO PECK THE FALCONS PIERCING TALONS
SO DESPERATE THIEVES ALL HOPELESS OF THEIR LIVES
BREATHE OUT INVECTIVES GAINST THE OFFICERS 
O CLIFFORD BUT BETHINK THEE ONCE AGAIN
AND IN THY THOUGHT OERRUN MY FORMER TIME
AND IF THOUGH CANST FOR BLUSHING VIEW THIS FACE
AND BITE THY TONGUE THAT SLANDERS HIM WITH COWARDICE
WHOSE FROWN HATH MADE THEE FAINT AND FLY ERE THIS 
I WILL NOT BANDY WITH THEE WORD FOR WORD
BUT BUCKLE WITH THEE BLOWS TWICE TWO FOR ONE 
HOLD VALIANT CLIFFORD  FOR A THOUSAND CAUSES
I WOULD PROLONG AWHILE THE TRAITORS LIFE 
WRATH MAKES HIM DEAF SPEAK THOU NORTHUMBERLAND 
HOLD CLIFFORD  DO NOT HONOUR HIM SO MUCH
TO PRICK THY FINGER THOUGH TO WOUND HIS HEART
WHAT VALOUR WERE IT WHEN A CUR DOTH GRIN
FOR ONE TO THRUST HIS HAND BETWEEN HIS TEETH
WHEN HE MIGHT SPURN HIM WITH HIS FOOT AWAY
IT IS WARS PRIZE TO TAKE ALL VANTAGES
AND TEN TO ONE IS NO IMPEACH OF VALOUR 
AY AY SO STRIVES THE WOODCOCK WITH THE GIN 
SO DOTH THE CONY STRUGGLE IN THE NET 
SO TRIUMPH THIEVES UPON THEIR CONQUERD BOOTY
SO TRUE MEN YIELD WITH ROBBERS SO OERMATCHD 
WHAT WOULD YOUR GRACE HAVE DONE UNTO HIM NOW
BRAVE WARRIORS CLIFFORD AND NORTHUMBERLAND
COME MAKE HIM STAND UPON THIS MOLEHILL HERE
THAT RAUGHT AT MOUNTAINS WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS
YET PARTED BUT THE SHADOW WITH HIS HAND 
WHAT  WAS IT YOU THAT WOULD BE ENGLANDS KING
WAST YOU THAT REVELLD IN OUR PARLIAMENT
AND MADE A PREACHMENT OF YOUR HIGH DESCENT
WHERE ARE YOUR MESS OF SONS TO BACK YOU NOW
THE WANTON EDWARD AND THE LUSTY GEORGE
AND WHERES THAT VALIANT CROOKBACK PRODIGY
DICKY YOUR BOY THAT WITH HIS GRUMBLING VOICE
WAS WONT TO CHEER HIS DAD IN MUTINIES
OR WITH THE REST WHERE IS YOUR DARLING RUTLAND
LOOK YORK I STAIND THIS NAPKIN WITH THE BLOOD
THAT VALIANT CLIFFORD WITH HIS RAPIERS POINT
MADE ISSUE FROM THE BOSOM OF THE BOY
AND IF THINE EYES CAN WATER FOR HIS DEATH
I GIVE THEE THIS TO DRY THY CHEEKS WITHAL 
ALAS POOR YORK  BUT THAT I HATE THEE DEADLY
I SHOULD LAMENT THY MISERABLE STATE 
I PRITHEE GRIEVE TO MAKE ME MERRY YORK 
WHAT HATH THY FIERY HEART SO PARCHD THINE ENTRAILS
THAT NOT A TEAR CAN FALL FOR RUTLANDS DEATH
WHY ART THOU PATIENT MAN THOU SHOULDST BE MAD
AND I TO MAKE THEE MAD DO MOCK THEE THUS 
STAMP RAVE AND FRET THAT I MAY SING AND DANCE 
THOU WOULDST BE FEED I SEE TO MAKE ME SPORT
YORK CANNOT SPEAK UNLESS HE WEAR A CROWN 
A CROWN FOR YORK  AND LORDS BOW LOW TO HIM
HOLD YOU HIS HANDS WHILST I DO SET IT ON 
AY MARRY SIR NOW LOOKS HE LIKE A KING 
AY THIS IS HE THAT TOOK KING HENRYS CHAIR
AND THIS IS HE WAS HIS ADOPTED HEIR 
BUT HOW IS IT THAT GREAT PLANTAGENET
IS CROWND SO SOON AND BROKE HIS SOLEMN OATH
AS I BETHINK ME YOU SHOULD NOT BE KING
TILL OUR KING HENRY HAD SHOOK HANDS WITH DEATH 
AND WILL YOU PALE YOUR HEAD IN HENRYS GLORY
AND ROB HIS TEMPLES OF THE DIADEM
NOW IN HIS LIFE AGAINST YOUR HOLY OATH
O TIS A FAULT TOO TOO UNPARDONABLE 
OFF WITH THE CROWN AND WITH THE CROWN HIS HEAD
AND WHILST WE BREATHE TAKE TIME TO DO HIM DEAD 
THAT IS MY OFFICE FOR MY FATHERS SAKE 
NAY STAY LETS HEAR THE ORISONS HE MAKES 
SHEWOLF OF FRANCE BUT WORSE THAN WOLVES OF FRANCE
WHOSE TONGUE MORE POISONS THAN THE ADDERS TOOTH 
HOW ILLBESEEMING IS IT IN THY SEX
TO TRIUMPH LIKE AN AMAZONIAN TRULL
UPON THEIR WOES WHOM FORTUNE CAPTIVATES 
BUT THAT THY FACE IS VIZARDLIKE UNCHANGING
MADE IMPUDENT WITH USE OF EVIL DEEDS
I WOULD ASSAY PROUD QUEEN TO MAKE THEE BLUSH 
TO TELL THEE WHENCE THOU CAMEST OF WHOM DERIVED
WERE SHAME ENOUGH TO SHAME THEE WERT THOU NOT SHAMELESS 
THY FATHER BEARS THE TYPE OF KING OF NAPLES
OF BOTH THE SICILS AND JERUSALEM
YET NOT SO WEALTHY AS AN ENGLISH YEOMAN 
HATH THAT POOR MONARCH TAUGHT THEE TO INSULT
IT NEEDS NOT NOR IT BOOTS THEE NOT PROUD QUEEN
UNLESS THE ADAGE MUST BE VERIFIED
THAT BEGGARS MOUNTED RUN THEIR HORSE TO DEATH 
TIS BEAUTY THAT DOTH OFT MAKE WOMEN PROUD
BUT GOD HE KNOWS THY SHARE THEREOF IS SMALL
TIS VIRTUE THAT DOTH MAKE THEM MOST ADMIRED
THE CONTRARY DOTH MAKE THEE WONDERD AT
TIS GOVERNMENT THAT MAKES THEM SEEM DIVINE
THE WANT THEREOF MAKES THEE ABOMINABLE
THOU ART AS OPPOSITE TO EVERY GOOD
AS THE ANTIPODES ARE UNTO US
OR AS THE SOUTH TO THE SEPTENTRION 
O TIGERS HEART WRAPT IN A WOMANS HIDE 
HOW COULDST THOU DRAIN THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE CHILD
TO BID THE FATHER WIPE HIS EYES WITHAL
AND YET BE SEEN TO BEAR A WOMANS FACE
WOMEN ARE SOFT MILD PITIFUL AND FLEXIBLE
THOU STERN OBDURATE FLINTY ROUGH REMORSELESS 
BIDST THOU ME RAGE WHY NOW THOU HAST THY WISH
WOULDST HAVE ME WEEP WHY NOW THOU HAST THY WILL
FOR RAGING WIND BLOWS UP INCESSANT SHOWERS
AND WHEN THE RAGE ALLAYS THE RAIN BEGINS 
THESE TEARS ARE MY SWEET RUTLANDS OBSEQUIES
AND EVERY DROP CRIES VENGEANCE FOR HIS DEATH
GAINST THEE FELL CLIFFORD AND THEE FALSE
FRENCHWOMAN 
BESHREW ME BUT HIS PASSION MOVES ME SO
THAT HARDLY CAN I CHEQUE MY EYES FROM TEARS 
THAT FACE OF HIS THE HUNGRY CANNIBALS
WOULD NOT HAVE TOUCHD WOULD NOT HAVE STAIND WITH BLOOD
BUT YOU ARE MORE INHUMAN MORE INEXORABLE
O TEN TIMES MORE THAN TIGERS OF HYRCANIA 
SEE RUTHLESS QUEEN A HAPLESS FATHERS TEARS
THIS CLOTH THOU DIPDST IN BLOOD OF MY SWEET BOY
AND I WITH TEARS DO WASH THE BLOOD AWAY 
KEEP THOU THE NAPKIN AND GO BOAST OF THIS
AND IF THOU TELLST THE HEAVY STORY RIGHT
UPON MY SOUL THE HEARERS WILL SHED TEARS
YEA EVEN MY FOES WILL SHED FASTFALLING TEARS
AND SAY ALAS IT WAS A PITEOUS DEED 
THERE TAKE THE CROWN AND WITH THE CROWN MY CURSE
AND IN THY NEED SUCH COMFORT COME TO THEE
AS NOW I REAP AT THY TOO CRUEL HAND 
HARDHEARTED CLIFFORD TAKE ME FROM THE WORLD
MY SOUL TO HEAVEN MY BLOOD UPON YOUR HEADS 
HAD HE BEEN SLAUGHTERMAN TO ALL MY KIN
I SHOULD NOT FOR MY LIFE BUT WEEP WITH HIM 
TO SEE HOW INLY SORROW GRIPES HIS SOUL 
WHAT WEEPINGRIPE MY LORD NORTHUMBERLAND
THINK BUT UPON THE WRONG HE DID US ALL
AND THAT WILL QUICKLY DRY THY MELTING TEARS 
HERES FOR MY OATH HERES FOR MY FATHERS DEATH 
AND HERES TO RIGHT OUR GENTLEHEARTED KING 
OPEN THY GATE OF MERCY GRACIOUS GOD 
MY SOUL FLIES THROUGH THESE WOUNDS TO SEEK OUT THEE 
OFF WITH HIS HEAD AND SET IT ON YORK GATES
SO YORK MAY OVERLOOK THE TOWN OF YORK 
 KING HENRY VI
I WONDER HOW OUR PRINCELY FATHER SCAPED
OR WHETHER HE BE SCAPED AWAY OR NO
FROM CLIFFORDS AND NORTHUMBERLANDS PURSUIT
HAD HE BEEN TAEN WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE NEWS
HAD HE BEEN SLAIN WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE NEWS
OR HAD HE SCAPED METHINKS WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THE HAPPY TIDINGS OF HIS GOOD ESCAPE 
HOW FARES MY BROTHER WHY IS HE SO SAD
I CANNOT JOY UNTIL I BE RESOLVED
WHERE OUR RIGHT VALIANT FATHER IS BECOME 
I SAW HIM IN THE BATTLE RANGE ABOUT
AND WATCHD HIM HOW HE SINGLED CLIFFORD FORTH 
METHOUGHT HE BORE HIM IN THE THICKEST TROOP
AS DOTH A LION IN A HERD OF NEAT
OR AS A BEAR ENCOMPASSD ROUND WITH DOGS
WHO HAVING PINCHD A FEW AND MADE THEM CRY
THE REST STAND ALL ALOOF AND BARK AT HIM 
SO FARED OUR FATHER WITH HIS ENEMIES
SO FLED HIS ENEMIES MY WARLIKE FATHER
METHINKS TIS PRIZE ENOUGH TO BE HIS SON 
SEE HOW THE MORNING OPES HER GOLDEN GATES
AND TAKES HER FAREWELL OF THE GLORIOUS SUN 
HOW WELL RESEMBLES IT THE PRIME OF YOUTH
TRIMMD LIKE A YOUNKER PRANCING TO HIS LOVE 
DAZZLE MINE EYES OR DO I SEE THREE SUNS
THREE GLORIOUS SUNS EACH ONE A PERFECT SUN
NOT SEPARATED WITH THE RACKING CLOUDS
BUT SEVERD IN A PALE CLEARSHINING SKY 
SEE SEE  THEY JOIN EMBRACE AND SEEM TO KISS
AS IF THEY VOWD SOME LEAGUE INVIOLABLE
NOW ARE THEY BUT ONE LAMP ONE LIGHT ONE SUN 
IN THIS THE HEAVEN FIGURES SOME EVENT 
TIS WONDROUS STRANGE THE LIKE YET NEVER HEARD OF 
I THINK IT CITES US BROTHER TO THE FIELD
THAT WE THE SONS OF BRAVE PLANTAGENET
EACH ONE ALREADY BLAZING BY OUR MEEDS
SHOULD NOTWITHSTANDING JOIN OUR LIGHTS TOGETHER
AND OVERSHINE THE EARTH AS THIS THE WORLD 
WHATEER IT BODES HENCEFORWARD WILL I BEAR
UPON MY TARGET THREE FAIRSHINING SUNS 
NAY BEAR THREE DAUGHTERS BY YOUR LEAVE I SPEAK IT
YOU LOVE THE BREEDER BETTER THAN THE MALE 
BUT WHAT ART THOU WHOSE HEAVY LOOKS FORETELL
SOME DREADFUL STORY HANGING ON THY TONGUE
AH ONE THAT WAS A WOFUL LOOKERON
WHEN AS THE NOBLE DUKE OF YORK WAS SLAIN
YOUR PRINCELY FATHER AND MY LOVING LORD 
O SPEAK NO MORE FOR I HAVE HEARD TOO MUCH 
SAY HOW HE DIED FOR I WILL HEAR IT ALL 
ENVIRONED HE WAS WITH MANY FOES
AND STOOD AGAINST THEM AS THE HOPE OF TROY
AGAINST THE GREEKS THAT WOULD HAVE ENTERD TROY 
BUT HERCULES HIMSELF MUST YIELD TO ODDS
AND MANY STROKES THOUGH WITH A LITTLE AXE
HEW DOWN AND FELL THE HARDESTTIMBERD OAK 
BY MANY HANDS YOUR FATHER WAS SUBDUED
BUT ONLY SLAUGHTERD BY THE IREFUL ARM
OF UNRELENTING CLIFFORD AND THE QUEEN
WHO CROWND THE GRACIOUS DUKE IN HIGH DESPITE
LAUGHD IN HIS FACE AND WHEN WITH GRIEF HE WEPT
THE RUTHLESS QUEEN GAVE HIM TO DRY HIS CHEEKS
A NAPKIN STEEPED IN THE HARMLESS BLOOD
OF SWEET YOUNG RUTLAND BY ROUGH CLIFFORD SLAIN
AND AFTER MANY SCORNS MANY FOUL TAUNTS
THEY TOOK HIS HEAD AND ON THE GATES OF YORK
THEY SET THE SAME AND THERE IT DOTH REMAIN
THE SADDEST SPECTACLE THAT EER I VIEWD 
SWEET DUKE OF YORK OUR PROP TO LEAN UPON
NOW THOU ART GONE WE HAVE NO STAFF NO STAY 
O CLIFFORD BOISTEROUS CLIFFORD  THOU HAST SLAIN
THE FLOWER OF EUROPE FOR HIS CHIVALRY
AND TREACHEROUSLY HAST THOU VANQUISHD HIM
FOR HAND TO HAND HE WOULD HAVE VANQUISHD THEE 
NOW MY SOULS PALACE IS BECOME A PRISON
AH WOULD SHE BREAK FROM HENCE THAT THIS MY BODY
MIGHT IN THE GROUND BE CLOSED UP IN REST 
FOR NEVER HENCEFORTH SHALL I JOY AGAIN
NEVER O NEVER SHALL I SEE MORE JOY 
I CANNOT WEEP FOR ALL MY BODYS MOISTURE
SCARCE SERVES TO QUENCH MY FURNACEBURNING HEART
NOR CAN MY TONGUE UNLOAD MY HEARTS GREAT BURTHEN
FOR SELFSAME WIND THAT I SHOULD SPEAK WITHAL
IS KINDLING COALS THAT FIRES ALL MY BREAST
AND BURNS ME UP WITH FLAMES THAT TEARS WOULD QUENCH 
TO WEEP IS TO MAKE LESS THE DEPTH OF GRIEF
TEARS THEN FOR BABES BLOWS AND REVENGE FOR ME
RICHARD I BEAR THY NAME ILL VENGE THY DEATH
OR DIE RENOWNED BY ATTEMPTING IT 
HIS NAME THAT VALIANT DUKE HATH LEFT WITH THEE
HIS DUKEDOM AND HIS CHAIR WITH ME IS LEFT 
NAY IF THOU BE THAT PRINCELY EAGLES BIRD
SHOW THY DESCENT BY GAZING GAINST THE SUN
FOR CHAIR AND DUKEDOM THRONE AND KINGDOM SAY
EITHER THAT IS THINE OR ELSE THOU WERT NOT HIS 
HOW NOW FAIR LORDS  WHAT FARE WHAT NEWS ABROAD
GREAT LORD OF WARWICK IF WE SHOULD RECOUNT
OUR BALEFUL NEWS AND AT EACH WORDS DELIVERANCE
STAB PONIARDS IN OUR FLESH TILL ALL WERE TOLD
THE WORDS WOULD ADD MORE ANGUISH THAN THE WOUNDS 
O VALIANT LORD THE DUKE OF YORK IS SLAIN 
O WARWICK WARWICK  THAT PLANTAGENET
WHICH HELD THREE DEARLY AS HIS SOULS REDEMPTION
IS BY THE STERN LORD CLIFFORD DONE TO DEATH 
TEN DAYS AGO I DROWND THESE NEWS IN TEARS
AND NOW TO ADD MORE MEASURE TO YOUR WOES
I COME TO TELL YOU THINGS SITH THEN BEFALLN 
AFTER THE BLOODY FRAY AT WAKEFIELD FOUGHT
WHERE YOUR BRAVE FATHER BREATHED HIS LATEST GASP
TIDINGS AS SWIFTLY AS THE POSTS COULD RUN
WERE BROUGHT ME OF YOUR LOSS AND HIS DEPART 
I THEN IN LONDON KEEPER OF THE KING
MUSTERD MY SOLDIERS GATHERD FLOCKS OF FRIENDS
AND VERY WELL APPOINTED AS I THOUGHT
MARCHD TOWARD SAINT ALBANS TO INTERCEPT THE QUEEN
BEARING THE KING IN MY BEHALF ALONG
FOR BY MY SCOUTS I WAS ADVERTISED
THAT SHE WAS COMING WITH A FULL INTENT
TO DASH OUR LATE DECREE IN PARLIAMENT
TOUCHING KING HENRYS OATH AND YOUR SUCCESSION 
SHORT TALE TO MAKE WE AT SAINT ALBANS MET
OUR BATTLES JOIND AND BOTH SIDES FIERCELY FOUGHT
BUT WHETHER TWAS THE COLDNESS OF THE KING
WHO LOOKD FULL GENTLY ON HIS WARLIKE QUEEN
THAT ROBBD MY SOLDIERS OF THEIR HEATED SPLEEN
OR WHETHER TWAS REPORT OF HER SUCCESS
OR MORE THAN COMMON FEAR OF CLIFFORDS RIGOUR
WHO THUNDERS TO HIS CAPTIVES BLOOD AND DEATH
I CANNOT JUDGE BUT TO CONCLUDE WITH TRUTH
THEIR WEAPONS LIKE TO LIGHTNING CAME AND WENT
OUR SOLDIERS LIKE THE NIGHTOWLS LAZY FLIGHT
OR LIKE AN IDLE THRESHER WITH A FLAIL
FELL GENTLY DOWN AS IF THEY STRUCK THEIR FRIENDS 
I CHEERD THEM UP WITH JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE
WITH PROMISE OF HIGH PAY AND GREAT REWARDS
BUT ALL IN VAIN THEY HAD NO HEART TO FIGHT
AND WE IN THEM NO HOPE TO WIN THE DAY
SO THAT WE FLED THE KING UNTO THE QUEEN
LORD GEORGE YOUR BROTHER NORFOLK AND MYSELF
IN HASTE POSTHASTE ARE COME TO JOIN WITH YOU
FOR IN THE MARCHES HERE WE HEARD YOU WERE
MAKING ANOTHER HEAD TO FIGHT AGAIN 
WHERE IS THE DUKE OF NORFOLK GENTLE WARWICK
AND WHEN CAME GEORGE FROM BURGUNDY TO ENGLAND
SOME SIX MILES OFF THE DUKE IS WITH THE SOLDIERS
AND FOR YOUR BROTHER HE WAS LATELY SENT
FROM YOUR KIND AUNT DUCHESS OF BURGUNDY
WITH AID OF SOLDIERS TO THIS NEEDFUL WAR 
TWAS ODDS BELIKE WHEN VALIANT WARWICK FLED
OFT HAVE I HEARD HIS PRAISES IN PURSUIT
BUT NEER TILL NOW HIS SCANDAL OF RETIRE 
NOR NOW MY SCANDAL RICHARD DOST THOU HEAR
FOR THOU SHALT KNOW THIS STRONG RIGHT HAND OF MINE
CAN PLUCK THE DIADEM FROM FAINT HENRYS HEAD
AND WRING THE AWFUL SCEPTRE FROM HIS FIST
WERE HE AS FAMOUS AND AS BOLD IN WAR
AS HE IS FAMED FOR MILDNESS PEACE AND PRAYER 
I KNOW IT WELL LORD WARWICK BLAME ME NOT
TIS LOVE I BEAR THY GLORIES MAKES ME SPEAK 
BUT IN THIS TROUBLOUS TIME WHATS TO BE DONE
SHALL WE GO THROW AWAY OUR COATS OF STEEL
AND WRAP OUR BODIES IN BLACK MOURNING GOWNS
NUMBERING OUR AVEMARIES WITH OUR BEADS
OR SHALL WE ON THE HELMETS OF OUR FOES
TELL OUR DEVOTION WITH REVENGEFUL ARMS
IF FOR THE LAST SAY AY AND TO IT LORDS 
WHY THEREFORE WARWICK CAME TO SEEK YOU OUT
AND THEREFORE COMES MY BROTHER MONTAGUE 
ATTEND ME LORDS  THE PROUD INSULTING QUEEN
WITH CLIFFORD AND THE HAUGHT NORTHUMBERLAND
AND OF THEIR FEATHER MANY MORE PROUD BIRDS
HAVE WROUGHT THE EASYMELTING KING LIKE WAX 
HE SWORE CONSENT TO YOUR SUCCESSION
HIS OATH ENROLLED IN THE PARLIAMENT
AND NOW TO LONDON ALL THE CREW ARE GONE
TO FRUSTRATE BOTH HIS OATH AND WHAT BESIDE
MAY MAKE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER 
THEIR POWER I THINK IS THIRTY THOUSAND STRONG
NOW IF THE HELP OF NORFOLK AND MYSELF
WITH ALL THE FRIENDS THAT THOU BRAVE EARL OF MARCH
AMONGST THE LOVING WELSHMEN CANST PROCURE
WILL BUT AMOUNT TO FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND
WHY VIA  TO LONDON WILL WE MARCH AMAIN
AND ONCE AGAIN BESTRIDE OUR FOAMING STEEDS
AND ONCE AGAIN CRY CHARGE UPON OUR FOES 
BUT NEVER ONCE AGAIN TURN BACK AND FLY 
AY NOW METHINKS I HEAR GREAT WARWICK SPEAK
NEER MAY HE LIVE TO SEE A SUNSHINE DAY
THAT CRIES RETIRE IF WARWICK BID HIM STAY 
LORD WARWICK ON THY SHOULDER WILL I LEAN
AND WHEN THOU FAILST AS GOD FORBID THE HOUR  
MUST EDWARD FALL WHICH PERIL HEAVEN FORFEND 
NO LONGER EARL OF MARCH BUT DUKE OF YORK
THE NEXT DEGREE IS ENGLANDS ROYAL THRONE
FOR KING OF ENGLAND SHALT THOU BE PROCLAIMD
IN EVERY BOROUGH AS WE PASS ALONG
AND HE THAT THROWS NOT UP HIS CAP FOR JOY
SHALL FOR THE FAULT MAKE FORFEIT OF HIS HEAD 
KING EDWARD VALIANT RICHARD MONTAGUE
STAY WE NO LONGER DREAMING OF RENOWN
BUT SOUND THE TRUMPETS AND ABOUT OUR TASK 
THEN CLIFFORD WERE THY HEART AS HARD AS STEEL
AS THOU HAST SHOWN IT FLINTY BY THY DEEDS
I COME TO PIERCE IT OR TO GIVE THEE MINE 
THEN STRIKE UP DRUMS GOD AND SAINT GEORGE FOR US 
HOW NOW  WHAT NEWS
THE DUKE OF NORFOLK SENDS YOU WORD BY ME
THE QUEEN IS COMING WITH A PUISSANT HOST
AND CRAVES YOUR COMPANY FOR SPEEDY COUNSEL 
WHY THEN IT SORTS BRAVE WARRIORS LETS AWAY 
 KING HENRY VI

THE SMALLEST WORM WILL TURN BEING TRODDEN ON
AND DOVES WILL PECK IN SAFEGUARD OF THEIR BROOD 
AMBITIOUS YORK DOTH LEVEL AT THY CROWN
THOU SMILING WHILE HE KNIT HIS ANGRY BROWS
HE BUT A DUKE WOULD HAVE HIS SON A KING
AND RAISE HIS ISSUE LIKE A LOVING SIRE
THOU BEING A KING BLEST WITH A GOODLY SON
DIDST YIELD CONSENT TO DISINHERIT HIM
WHICH ARGUED THEE A MOST UNLOVING FATHER 
UNREASONABLE CREATURES FEED THEIR YOUNG
AND THOUGH MANS FACE BE FEARFUL TO THEIR EYES
YET IN PROTECTION OF THEIR TENDER ONES
WHO HATH NOT SEEN THEM EVEN WITH THOSE WINGS
WHICH SOMETIME THEY HAVE USED WITH FEARFUL FLIGHT
MAKE WAR WITH HIM THAT CLIMBD UNTO THEIR NEST
OFFER THEIR OWN LIVES IN THEIR YOUNGS DEFENCE
FOR SHAME MY LIEGE MAKE THEM YOUR PRECEDENT 
WERE IT NOT PITY THAT THIS GOODLY BOY
SHOULD LOSE HIS BIRTHRIGHT BY HIS FATHERS FAULT
AND LONG HEREAFTER SAY UNTO HIS CHILD
WHAT MY GREATGRANDFATHER AND HIS GRANDSIRE GOT
MY CARELESS FATHER FONDLY GAVE AWAY
AH WHAT A SHAME WERE THIS  LOOK ON THE BOY
AND LET HIS MANLY FACE WHICH PROMISETH
SUCCESSFUL FORTUNE STEEL THY MELTING HEART
TO HOLD THINE OWN AND LEAVE THINE OWN WITH HIM 
FULL WELL HATH CLIFFORD PLAYD THE ORATOR
INFERRING ARGUMENTS OF MIGHTY FORCE 
BUT CLIFFORD TELL ME DIDST THOU NEVER HEAR
THAT THINGS ILLGOT HAD EVER BAD SUCCESS
AND HAPPY ALWAYS WAS IT FOR THAT SON
WHOSE FATHER FOR HIS HOARDING WENT TO HELL
ILL LEAVE MY SON MY VIRTUOUS DEEDS BEHIND

BECOMES IT THEE TO BE THUS BOLD IN TERMS
BEFORE THY SOVEREIGN AND THY LAWFUL KING

IF THOU DENY THEIR BLOOD UPON THY HEAD
FOR YORK IN JUSTICE PUTS HIS ARMOUR ON 
IF THAT BE RIGHT WHICH WARWICK SAYS IS RIGHT
THERE IS NO WRONG BUT EVERY THING IS RIGHT 
WHOEVER GOT THEE THERE THY MOTHER STANDS
FOR WELL I WOT THOU HAST THY MOTHERS TONGUE 
BUT THOU ART NEITHER LIKE THY SIRE NOR DAM
BUT LIKE A FOUL MISSHAPEN STIGMATIC
MARKD BY THE DESTINIES TO BE AVOIDED
AS VENOM TOADS OR LIZARDS DREADFUL STINGS 
IRON OF NAPLES HID WITH ENGLISH GILT
WHOSE FATHER BEARS THE TITLE OF A KING 
AS IF A CHANNEL SHOULD BE CALLD THE SEA 
SHAMEST THOU NOT KNOWING WHENCE THOU ART EXTRAUGHT
TO LET THY TONGUE DETECT THY BASEBORN HEART
A WISP OF STRAW WERE WORTH A THOUSAND CROWNS
TO MAKE THIS SHAMELESS CALLET KNOW HERSELF 
HELEN OF GREECE WAS FAIRER FAR THAN THOU
ALTHOUGH THY HUSBAND MAY BE MENELAUS
AND NEER WAS AGAMEMNONS BROTHER WRONGD
BY THAT FALSE WOMAN AS THIS KING BY THEE 
HIS FATHER REVELLD IN THE HEART OF FRANCE
AND TAMED THE KING AND MADE THE DAUPHIN STOOP
AND HAD HE MATCHD ACCORDING TO HIS STATE
HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT THAT GLORY TO THIS DAY
BUT WHEN HE TOOK A BEGGAR TO HIS BED
AND GRACED THY POOR SIRE WITH HIS BRIDALDAY
EVEN THEN THAT SUNSHINE BREWD A SHOWER FOR HIM
THAT WASHD HIS FATHERS FORTUNES FORTH OF FRANCE
AND HEAPD SEDITION ON HIS CROWN AT HOME 
FOR WHAT HATH BROACHD THIS TUMULT BUT THY PRIDE
HADST THOU BEEN MEEK OUR TITLE STILL HAD SLEPT
AND WE IN PITY OF THE GENTLE KING
HAD SLIPPD OUR CLAIM UNTIL ANOTHER AGE 
BUT WHEN WE SAW OUR SUNSHINE MADE THY SPRING
AND THAT THY SUMMER BRED US NO INCREASE
WE SET THE AXE TO THY USURPING ROOT
AND THOUGH THE EDGE HATH SOMETHING HIT OURSELVES
YET KNOW THOU SINCE WE HAVE BEGUN TO STRIKE
WELL NEVER LEAVE TILL WE HAVE HEWN THEE DOWN
OR BATHED THY GROWING WITH OUR HEATED BLOODS 
AND IN THIS RESOLUTION I DEFY THEE
NOT WILLING ANY LONGER CONFERENCE
SINCE THOU DENIEST THE GENTLE KING TO SPEAK 
SOUND TRUMPETS  LET OUR BLOODY COLOURS WAVE 
AND EITHER VICTORY OR ELSE A GRAVE 
STAY EDWARD 
NO WRANGLING WOMAN WELL NO LONGER STAY
THESE WORDS WILL COST TEN THOUSAND LIVES THIS DAY 
 KING HENRY VI
FORSPENT WITH TOIL AS RUNNERS WITH A RACE
I LAY ME DOWN A LITTLE WHILE TO BREATHE
FOR STROKES RECEIVED AND MANY BLOWS REPAID
HAVE ROBBD MY STRONGKNIT SINEWS OF THEIR STRENGTH
AND SPITE OF SPITE NEEDS MUST I REST AWHILE 
SMILE GENTLE HEAVEN  OR STRIKE UNGENTLE DEATH 
FOR THIS WORLD FROWNS AND EDWARDS SUN IS CLOUDED 
HOW NOW MY LORD  WHAT HAP WHAT HOPE OF GOOD
OUR HAP IS LOSS OUR HOPE BUT SAD DESPAIR
OUR RANKS ARE BROKE AND RUIN FOLLOWS US
WHAT COUNSEL GIVE YOU WHITHER SHALL WE FLY
BOOTLESS IS FLIGHT THEY FOLLOW US WITH WINGS
AND WEAK WE ARE AND CANNOT SHUN PURSUIT 
AH WARWICK WHY HAST THOU WITHDRAWN THYSELF

BROACHD WITH THE STEELY POINT OF CLIFFORDS LANCE
AND IN THE VERY PANGS OF DEATH HE CRIED
LIKE TO A DISMAL CLANGOUR HEARD FROM FAR
WARWICK REVENGE  BROTHER REVENGE MY DEATH 
SO UNDERNEATH THE BELLY OF THEIR STEEDS
THAT STAIND THEIR FETLOCKS IN HIS SMOKING BLOOD
THE NOBLE GENTLEMAN GAVE UP THE GHOST 
THEN LET THE EARTH BE DRUNKEN WITH OUR BLOOD
ILL KILL MY HORSE BECAUSE I WILL NOT FLY 
WHY STAND WE LIKE SOFTHEARTED WOMEN HERE
WAILING OUR LOSSES WHILES THE FOE DOTH RAGE

 KING HENRY VI
NOW CLIFFORD I HAVE SINGLED THEE ALONE
SUPPOSE THIS ARM IS FOR THE DUKE OF YORK
AND THIS FOR RUTLAND BOTH BOUND TO REVENGE
WERT THOU ENVIROND WITH A BRAZEN WALL 
NOW RICHARD I AM WITH THEE HERE ALONE
THIS IS THE HAND THAT STABBD THY FATHER YORK
AND THIS THE HAND THAT SLEW THY BROTHER RUTLAND
AND HERES THE HEART THAT TRIUMPHS IN THEIR DEATH
AND CHEERS THESE HANDS THAT SLEW THY SIRE AND BROTHER
TO EXECUTE THE LIKE UPON THYSELF
AND SO HAVE AT THEE 
NAY WARWICK SINGLE OUT SOME OTHER CHASE
FOR I MYSELF WILL HUNT THIS WOLF TO DEATH 
 KING HENRY VI
THIS BATTLE FARES LIKE TO THE MORNINGS WAR
WHEN DYING CLOUDS CONTEND WITH GROWING LIGHT
WHAT TIME THE SHEPHERD BLOWING OF HIS NAILS
CAN NEITHER CALL IT PERFECT DAY NOR NIGHT 
NOW SWAYS IT THIS WAY LIKE A MIGHTY SEA
FORCED BY THE TIDE TO COMBAT WITH THE WIND
NOW SWAYS IT THAT WAY LIKE THE SELFSAME SEA
FORCED TO RETIRE BY FURY OF THE WIND
SOMETIME THE FLOOD PREVAILS AND THEN THE WIND
NOW ONE THE BETTER THEN ANOTHER BEST
BOTH TUGGING TO BE VICTORS BREAST TO BREAST
YET NEITHER CONQUEROR NOR CONQUERED
SO IS THE EQUAL OF THIS FELL WAR 
HERE ON THIS MOLEHILL WILL I SIT ME DOWN 
TO WHOM GOD WILL THERE BE THE VICTORY 
FOR MARGARET MY QUEEN AND CLIFFORD TOO
HAVE CHID ME FROM THE BATTLE SWEARING BOTH
THEY PROSPER BEST OF ALL WHEN I AM THENCE 
WOULD I WERE DEAD  IF GODS GOOD WILL WERE SO
FOR WHAT IS IN THIS WORLD BUT GRIEF AND WOE
O GOD  METHINKS IT WERE A HAPPY LIFE
TO BE NO BETTER THAN A HOMELY SWAIN
TO SIT UPON A HILL AS I DO NOW
TO CARVE OUT DIALS QUAINTLY POINT BY POINT
THEREBY TO SEE THE MINUTES HOW THEY RUN
HOW MANY MAKE THE HOUR FULL COMPLETE
HOW MANY HOURS BRING ABOUT THE DAY
HOW MANY DAYS WILL FINISH UP THE YEAR
HOW MANY YEARS A MORTAL MAN MAY LIVE 
WHEN THIS IS KNOWN THEN TO DIVIDE THE TIMES
SO MANY HOURS MUST I TEND MY FLOCK
SO MANY HOURS MUST I TAKE MY REST
SO MANY HOURS MUST I CONTEMPLATE
SO MANY HOURS MUST I SPORT MYSELF
SO MANY DAYS MY EWES HAVE BEEN WITH YOUNG
SO MANY WEEKS ERE THE POOR FOOLS WILL EAN
SO MANY YEARS ERE I SHALL SHEAR THE FLEECE
SO MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS AND YEARS
PASSD OVER TO THE END THEY WERE CREATED
WOULD BRING WHITE HAIRS UNTO A QUIET GRAVE 
AH WHAT A LIFE WERE THIS  HOW SWEET  HOW LOVELY 
GIVES NOT THE HAWTHORNBUSH A SWEETER SHADE
TO SHEPHERDS LOOKING ON THEIR SILLY SHEEP
THAN DOTH A RICH EMBROIDERD CANOPY
TO KINGS THAT FEAR THEIR SUBJECTS TREACHERY
O YES IT DOTH A THOUSANDFOLD IT DOTH 
AND TO CONCLUDE THE SHEPHERDS HOMELY CURDS
HIS COLD THIN DRINK OUT OF HIS LEATHER BOTTLE 
HIS WONTED SLEEP UNDER A FRESH TREES SHADE
ALL WHICH SECURE AND SWEETLY HE ENJOYS
IS FAR BEYOND A PRINCES DELICATES
HIS VIANDS SPARKLING IN A GOLDEN CUP
HIS BODY COUCHED IN A CURIOUS BED
WHEN CARE MISTRUST AND TREASON WAITS ON HIM 
ILL BLOWS THE WIND THAT PROFITS NOBODY 
THIS MAN WHOM HAND TO HAND I SLEW IN FIGHT
MAY BE POSSESSED WITH SOME STORE OF CROWNS
AND I THAT HAPLY TAKE THEM FROM HIM NOW
MAY YET ERE NIGHT YIELD BOTH MY LIFE AND THEM
TO SOME MAN ELSE AS THIS DEAD MAN DOTH ME 
WHOS THIS O GOD  IT IS MY FATHERS FACE
WHOM IN THIS CONFLICT I UNWARES HAVE KILLD 
O HEAVY TIMES BEGETTING SUCH EVENTS 
FROM LONDON BY THE KING WAS I PRESSD FORTH

AND HENRY HADST THOU SWAYD AS KINGS SHOULD DO
OR AS THY FATHER AND HIS FATHER DID
GIVING NO GROUND UNTO THE HOUSE OF YORK
THEY NEVER THEN HAD SPRUNG LIKE SUMMER FLIES
I AND TEN THOUSAND IN THIS LUCKLESS REALM

AND THOU THIS DAY HADST KEPT THY CHAIR IN PEACE 
FOR WHAT DOTH CHERISH WEEDS BUT GENTLE AIR

BOOTLESS ARE PLAINTS AND CURELESS ARE MY WOUNDS
NO WAY TO FLY NOR STRENGTH TO HOLD OUT FLIGHT

WHOSE SOUL IS THAT WHICH TAKES HER HEAVY LEAVE
A DEADLY GROAN LIKE LIFE AND DEATHS DEPARTING

IF FRIEND OR FOE LET HIM BE GENTLY USED 
REVOKE THAT DOOM OF MERCY FOR TIS CLIFFORD
WHO NOT CONTENTED THAT HE LOPPD THE BRANCH
IN HEWING RUTLAND WHEN HIS LEAVES PUT FORTH
BUT SET HIS MURDERING KNIFE UNTO THE ROOT

WHICH IN THE TIME OF DEATH HE GAVE OUR FATHER 
IF SO THOU THINKST VEX HIM WITH EAGER WORDS 
CLIFFORD ASK MERCY AND OBTAIN NO GRACE 
CLIFFORD REPENT IN BOOTLESS PENITENCE

FORBEAR AWHILE WELL HEAR A LITTLE MORE 
MY QUEEN AND SON ARE GONE TO FRANCE FOR AID
AND AS I HEAR THE GREAT COMMANDING WARWICK
IS THITHER GONE TO CRAVE THE FRENCH KINGS SISTER
TO WIFE FOR EDWARD IF THIS NEWS BE TRUE
POOR QUEEN AND SON YOUR LABOUR IS BUT LOST
FOR WARWICK IS A SUBTLE ORATOR
AND LEWIS A PRINCE SOON WON WITH MOVING WORDS 
BY THIS ACCOUNT THEN MARGARET MAY WIN HIM
FOR SHES A WOMAN TO BE PITIED MUCH
HER SIGHS WILL MAKE A BATTERY IN HIS BREAST
HER TEARS WILL PIERCE INTO A MARBLE HEART
THE TIGER WILL BE MILD WHILES SHE DOTH MOURN
AND NERO WILL BE TAINTED WITH REMORSE
TO HEAR AND SEE HER PLAINTS HER BRINISH TEARS 
AY BUT SHES COME TO BEG WARWICK TO GIVE
SHE ON HIS LEFT SIDE CRAVING AID FOR HENRY
HE ON HIS RIGHT ASKING A WIFE FOR EDWARD 
SHE WEEPS AND SAYS HER HENRY IS DEPOSED
HE SMILES AND SAYS HIS EDWARD IS INSTALLD
THAT SHE POOR WRETCH FOR GRIEF CAN SPEAK NO MORE
WHILES WARWICK TELLS HIS TITLE SMOOTHS THE WRONG
INFERRETH ARGUMENTS OF MIGHTY STRENGTH
AND IN CONCLUSION WINS THE KING FROM HER
WITH PROMISE OF HIS SISTER AND WHAT ELSE
TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT KING EDWARDS PLACE 
O MARGARET THUS TWILL BE AND THOU POOR SOUL

SAY WHAT ART THOU THAT TALKST OF KINGS AND QUEENS
MORE THAN I SEEM AND LESS THAN I WAS BORN TO
A MAN AT LEAST FOR LESS I SHOULD NOT BE
AND MEN MAY TALK OF KINGS AND WHY NOT I
AY BUT THOU TALKST AS IF THOU WERT A KING 
WHY SO I AM IN MIND AND THATS ENOUGH 
BUT IF THOU BE A KING WHERE IS THY CROWN
MY CROWN IS IN MY HEART NOT ON MY HEAD
NOT DECKED WITH DIAMONDS AND INDIAN STONES
NOR TO BE SEEN MY CROWN IS CALLED CONTENT
A CROWN IT IS THAT SELDOM KINGS ENJOY 
WELL IF YOU BE A KING CROWND WITH CONTENT

TO GO ALONG WITH US FOR AS WE THINK
YOU ARE THE KING KING EDWARD HATH DEPOSED
AND WE HIS SUBJECTS SWORN IN ALL ALLEGIANCE

BUT DID YOU NEVER SWEAR AND BREAK AN OATH
NO NEVER SUCH AN OATH NOR WILL NOT NOW 
WHERE DID YOU DWELL WHEN I WAS KING OF ENGLAND
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE NOW REMAIN 
I WAS ANOINTED KING AT NINE MONTHS OLD
MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER WERE KINGS
AND YOU WERE SWORN TRUE SUBJECTS UNTO ME
AND TELL ME THEN HAVE YOU NOT BROKE YOUR OATHS
NO
FOR WE WERE SUBJECTS BUT WHILE YOU WERE KING 
WHY AM I DEAD DO I NOT BREATHE A MAN
AH SIMPLE MEN YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU SWEAR 
LOOK AS I BLOW THIS FEATHER FROM MY FACE
AND AS THE AIR BLOWS IT TO ME AGAIN
OBEYING WITH MY WIND WHEN I DO BLOW
AND YIELDING TO ANOTHER WHEN IT BLOWS
COMMANDED ALWAYS BY THE GREATER GUST
SUCH IS THE LIGHTNESS OF YOU COMMON MEN 
BUT DO NOT BREAK YOUR OATHS FOR OF THAT SIN
MY MILD ENTREATY SHALL NOT MAKE YOU GUILTY 
GO WHERE YOU WILL THE KING SHALL BE COMMANDED
AND BE YOU KINGS COMMAND AND ILL OBEY 
WE ARE TRUE SUBJECTS TO THE KING KING EDWARD 
SO WOULD YOU BE AGAIN TO HENRY

TO GO WITH US UNTO THE OFFICERS 
IN GODS NAME LEAD YOUR KINGS NAME BE OBEYD
AND WHAT GOD WILL THAT LET YOUR KING PERFORM
AND WHAT HE WILL I HUMBLY YIELD UNTO

WHY THEN I WILL DO WHAT YOUR GRACE COMMANDS 
  HE PLIES HER HARD AND MUCH RAIN

  THE WIDOW LIKES HIM NOT SHE
KNITS HER BROWS 
  HE IS THE BLUNTEST WOOER IN
CHRISTENDOM 
  HER LOOKS DO ARGUE HER REPLETE WITH MODESTY
HER WORDS DO SHOW HER WIT INCOMPARABLE
ALL HER PERFECTIONS CHALLENGE SOVEREIGNTY
ONE WAY OR OTHER SHE IS FOR A KING
AND SHE SHALL BE MY LOVE OR ELSE MY QUEEN  
SAY THAT KING EDWARD TAKE THEE FOR HIS QUEEN
TIS BETTER SAID THAN DONE MY GRACIOUS LORD
I AM A SUBJECT FIT TO JEST WITHAL
BUT FAR UNFIT TO BE A SOVEREIGN 
SWEET WIDOW BY MY STATE I SWEAR TO THEE
I SPEAK NO MORE THAN WHAT MY SOUL INTENDS
AND THAT IS TO ENJOY THEE FOR MY LOVE 
AND THAT IS MORE THAN I WILL YIELD UNTO
I KNOW I AM TOO MEAN TO BE YOUR QUEEN
AND YET TOO GOOD TO BE YOUR CONCUBINE 
YOU CAVIL WIDOW I DID MEAN MY QUEEN 
TWILL GRIEVE YOUR GRACE MY SONS SHOULD CALL YOU FATHER 
NO MORE THAN WHEN MY DAUGHTERS CALL THEE MOTHER 
THOU ART A WIDOW AND THOU HAST SOME CHILDREN
AND BY GODS MOTHER I BEING BUT A BACHELOR
HAVE OTHER SOME WHY TIS A HAPPY THING
TO BE THE FATHER UNTO MANY SONS 
ANSWER NO MORE FOR THOU SHALT BE MY QUEEN 
  THE GHOSTLY FATHER NOW HATH DONE
HIS SHRIFT 
  WHEN HE WAS MADE A SHRIVER
TWAS FOR SHIFT 
BROTHERS YOU MUSE WHAT CHAT WE TWO HAVE HAD 
THE WIDOW LIKES IT NOT FOR SHE LOOKS VERY SAD 
YOULL THINK IT STRANGE IF I SHOULD MARRY HER 
TO WHOM MY LORD
WHY CLARENCE TO MYSELF 
THAT WOULD BE TEN DAYS WONDER AT THE LEAST 
THATS A DAY LONGER THAN A WONDER LASTS 
BY SO MUCH IS THE WONDER IN EXTREMES 
WELL JEST ON BROTHERS I CAN TELL YOU BOTH
HER SUIT IS GRANTED FOR HER HUSBANDS LANDS 
MY GRACIOUS LORD HENRY YOUR FOE IS TAKEN
AND BROUGHT YOUR PRISONER TO YOUR PALACE GATE 
SEE THAT HE BE CONVEYD UNTO THE TOWER
AND GO WE BROTHERS TO THE MAN THAT TOOK HIM
TO QUESTION OF HIS APPREHENSION 
WIDOW GO YOU ALONG  LORDS USE HER HONOURABLY 
AY EDWARD WILL USE WOMEN HONOURABLY 
WOULD HE WERE WASTED MARROW BONES AND ALL
THAT FROM HIS LOINS NO HOPEFUL BRANCH MAY SPRING
TO CROSS ME FROM THE GOLDEN TIME I LOOK FOR 
AND YET BETWEEN MY SOULS DESIRE AND ME 
THE LUSTFUL EDWARDS TITLE BURIED 
IS CLARENCE HENRY AND HIS SON YOUNG EDWARD
AND ALL THE UNLOOKD FOR ISSUE OF THEIR BODIES
TO TAKE THEIR ROOMS ERE I CAN PLACE MYSELF
A COLD PREMEDITATION FOR MY PURPOSE 
WHY THEN I DO BUT DREAM ON SOVEREIGNTY
LIKE ONE THAT STANDS UPON A PROMONTORY
AND SPIES A FAROFF SHORE WHERE HE WOULD TREAD
WISHING HIS FOOT WERE EQUAL WITH HIS EYE
AND CHIDES THE SEA THAT SUNDERS HIM FROM THENCE
SAYING HELL LADE IT DRY TO HAVE HIS WAY
SO DO I WISH THE CROWN BEING SO FAR OFF
AND SO I CHIDE THE MEANS THAT KEEPS ME FROM IT
AND SO I SAY ILL CUT THE CAUSES OFF
FLATTERING ME WITH IMPOSSIBILITIES 
MY EYES TOO QUICK MY HEART OERWEENS TOO MUCH
UNLESS MY HAND AND STRENGTH COULD EQUAL THEM 
WELL SAY THERE IS NO KINGDOM THEN FOR RICHARD
WHAT OTHER PLEASURE CAN THE WORLD AFFORD
ILL MAKE MY HEAVEN IN A LADYS LAP
AND DECK MY BODY IN GAY ORNAMENTS
AND WITCH SWEET LADIES WITH MY WORDS AND LOOKS 
O MISERABLE THOUGHT  AND MORE UNLIKELY
THAN TO ACCOMPLISH TWENTY GOLDEN CROWNS 
WHY LOVE FORSWORE ME IN MY MOTHERS WOMB
AND FOR I SHOULD NOT DEAL IN HER SOFT LAWS
SHE DID CORRUPT FRAIL NATURE WITH SOME BRIBE
TO SHRINK MINE ARM UP LIKE A WITHERD SHRUB
TO MAKE AN ENVIOUS MOUNTAIN ON MY BACK
WHERE SITS DEFORMITY TO MOCK MY BODY
TO SHAPE MY LEGS OF AN UNEQUAL SIZE
TO DISPROPORTION ME IN EVERY PART
LIKE TO A CHAOS OR AN UNLICKD BEARWHELP
THAT CARRIES NO IMPRESSION LIKE THE DAM 
AND AM I THEN A MAN TO BE BELOVED
O MONSTROUS FAULT TO HARBOUR SUCH A THOUGHT 
THEN SINCE THIS EARTH AFFORDS NO JOY TO ME
BUT TO COMMAND TO CHEQUE TO OERBEAR SUCH
AS ARE OF BETTER PERSON THAN MYSELF
ILL MAKE MY HEAVEN TO DREAM UPON THE CROWN
AND WHILES I LIVE TO ACCOUNT THIS WORLD BUT HELL
UNTIL MY MISSHAPED TRUNK THAT BEARS THIS HEAD
BE ROUND IMPALED WITH A GLORIOUS CROWN 
AND YET I KNOW NOT HOW TO GET THE CROWN
FOR MANY LIVES STAND BETWEEN ME AND HOME
AND I LIKE ONE LOST IN A THORNY WOOD
THAT RENDS THE THORNS AND IS RENT WITH THE THORNS
SEEKING A WAY AND STRAYING FROM THE WAY
NOT KNOWING HOW TO FIND THE OPEN AIR
BUT TOILING DESPERATELY TO FIND IT OUT 
TORMENT MYSELF TO CATCH THE ENGLISH CROWN
AND FROM THAT TORMENT I WILL FREE MYSELF
OR HEW MY WAY OUT WITH A BLOODY AXE 
WHY I CAN SMILE AND MURDER WHILES I SMILE
AND CRY CONTENT TO THAT WHICH GRIEVES MY HEART
AND WET MY CHEEKS WITH ARTIFICIAL TEARS
AND FRAME MY FACE TO ALL OCCASIONS 
ILL DROWN MORE SAILORS THAN THE MERMAID SHALL
ILL SLAY MORE GAZERS THAN THE BASILISK
ILL PLAY THE ORATOR AS WELL AS NESTOR
DECEIVE MORE SLILY THAN ULYSSES COULD
AND LIKE A SINON TAKE ANOTHER TROY 
I CAN ADD COLOURS TO THE CHAMELEON
CHANGE SHAPES WITH PROTEUS FOR ADVANTAGES
AND SET THE MURDEROUS MACHIAVEL TO SCHOOL 
CAN I DO THIS AND CANNOT GET A CROWN
TUT WERE IT FARTHER OFF ILL PLUCK IT DOWN 
 KING HENRY VI
FAIR QUEEN OF ENGLAND WORTHY MARGARET
SIT DOWN WITH US IT ILL BEFITS THY STATE
AND BIRTH THAT THOU SHOULDST STAND WHILE LEWIS DOTH SIT 
NO MIGHTY KING OF FRANCE NOW MARGARET
MUST STRIKE HER SAIL AND LEARN AWHILE TO SERVE
WHERE KINGS COMMAND  I WAS I MUST CONFESS
GREAT ALBIONS QUEEN IN FORMER GOLDEN DAYS
BUT NOW MISCHANCE HATH TROD MY TITLE DOWN
AND WITH DISHONOUR LAID ME ON THE GROUND
WHERE I MUST TAKE LIKE SEAT UNTO MY FORTUNE
AND TO MY HUMBLE SEAT CONFORM MYSELF 
WHY SAY FAIR QUEEN WHENCE SPRINGS THIS DEEP DESPAIR
FROM SUCH A CAUSE AS FILLS MINE EYES WITH TEARS
AND STOPS MY TONGUE WHILE HEART IS DROWND IN CARES 
WHATEER IT BE BE THOU STILL LIKE THYSELF
AND SIT THEE BY OUR SIDE
YIELD NOT THY NECK
TO FORTUNES YOKE BUT LET THY DAUNTLESS MIND
STILL RIDE IN TRIUMPH OVER ALL MISCHANCE 
BE PLAIN QUEEN MARGARET AND TELL THY GRIEF
IT SHALL BE EASED IF FRANCE CAN YIELD RELIEF 
THOSE GRACIOUS WORDS REVIVE MY DROOPING THOUGHTS
AND GIVE MY TONGUETIED SORROWS LEAVE TO SPEAK 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT KNOWN TO NOBLE LEWIS
THAT HENRY SOLE POSSESSOR OF MY LOVE
IS OF A KING BECOME A BANISHD MAN
AND FORCED TO LIVE IN SCOTLAND A FORLORN
WHILE PROUD AMBITIOUS EDWARD DUKE OF YORK
USURPS THE REGAL TITLE AND THE SEAT
OF ENGLANDS TRUEANOINTED LAWFUL KING 
THIS IS THE CAUSE THAT I POOR MARGARET
WITH THIS MY SON PRINCE EDWARD HENRYS HEIR
AM COME TO CRAVE THY JUST AND LAWFUL AID
AND IF THOU FAIL US ALL OUR HOPE IS DONE
SCOTLAND HATH WILL TO HELP BUT CANNOT HELP
OUR PEOPLE AND OUR PEERS ARE BOTH MISLED
OUR TREASURES SEIZED OUR SOLDIERS PUT TO FLIGHT
AND AS THOU SEEST OURSELVES IN HEAVY PLIGHT 
RENOWNED QUEEN WITH PATIENCE CALM THE STORM
WHILE WE BETHINK A MEANS TO BREAK IT OFF 
THE MORE WE STAY THE STRONGER GROWS OUR FOE 
THE MORE I STAY THE MORE ILL SUCCOR THEE 
O BUT IMPATIENCE WAITETH ON TRUE SORROW 
AND SEE WHERE COMES THE BREEDER OF MY SORROW 
WHATS HE APPROACHETH BOLDLY TO OUR PRESENCE
OUR EARL OF WARWICK EDWARDS GREATEST FRIEND 
WELCOME BRAVE WARWICK  WHAT BRINGS THEE TO FRANCE
AY NOW BEGINS A SECOND STORM TO RISE
FOR THIS IS HE THAT MOVES BOTH WIND AND TIDE 
FROM WORTHY EDWARD KING OF ALBION
MY LORD AND SOVEREIGN AND THY VOWED FRIEND
I COME IN KINDNESS AND UNFEIGNED LOVE
FIRST TO DO GREETINGS TO THY ROYAL PERSON
AND THEN TO CRAVE A LEAGUE OF AMITY
AND LASTLY TO CONFIRM THAT AMITY
WITH A NUPTIAL KNOT IF THOU VOUCHSAFE TO GRANT
THAT VIRTUOUS LADY BONA THY FAIR SISTER
TO ENGLANDS KING IN LAWFUL MARRIAGE 
  IF THAT GO FORWARD HENRYS HOPE IS DONE 
  AND GRACIOUS MADAM IN OUR KINGS BEHALF
I AM COMMANDED WITH YOUR LEAVE AND FAVOUR
HUMBLY TO KISS YOUR HAND AND WITH MY TONGUE
TO TELL THE PASSION OF MY SOVEREIGNS HEART
WHERE FAME LATE ENTERING AT HIS HEEDFUL EARS
HATH PLACED THY BEAUTYS IMAGE AND THY VIRTUE 
KING LEWIS AND LADY BONA HEAR ME SPEAK
BEFORE YOU ANSWER WARWICK  HIS DEMAND
SPRINGS NOT FROM EDWARDS WELLMEANT HONEST LOVE
BUT FROM DECEIT BRED BY NECESSITY
FOR HOW CAN TYRANTS SAFELY GOVERN HOME
UNLESS ABROAD THEY PURCHASE GREAT ALLIANCE
TO PROVE HIM TYRANT THIS REASON MAY SUFFICE
THAT HENRY LIVETH STILL BUT WERE HE DEAD
YET HERE PRINCE EDWARD STANDS KING HENRYS SON 
LOOK THEREFORE LEWIS THAT BY THIS LEAGUE AND MARRIAGE
THOU DRAW NOT ON THY DANGER AND DISHONOUR
FOR THOUGH USURPERS SWAY THE RULE AWHILE
YET HEAVENS ARE JUST AND TIME SUPPRESSETH WRONGS 
INJURIOUS MARGARET 
AND WHY NOT QUEEN
BECAUSE THY FATHER HENRY DID USURP
AND THOU NO MORE ARE PRINCE THAN SHE IS QUEEN 
THEN WARWICK DISANNULS GREAT JOHN OF GAUNT
WHICH DID SUBDUE THE GREATEST PART OF SPAIN
AND AFTER JOHN OF GAUNT HENRY THE FOURTH
WHOSE WISDOM WAS A MIRROR TO THE WISEST
AND AFTER THAT WISE PRINCE HENRY THE FIFTH
WHO BY HIS PROWESS CONQUERED ALL FRANCE
FROM THESE OUR HENRY LINEALLY DESCENDS 
OXFORD HOW HAPS IT IN THIS SMOOTH DISCOURSE
YOU TOLD NOT HOW HENRY THE SIXTH HATH LOST
ALL THAT WHICH HENRY FIFTH HAD GOTTEN
METHINKS THESE PEERS OF FRANCE SHOULD SMILE AT THAT 
BUT FOR THE REST YOU TELL A PEDIGREE
OF THREESCORE AND TWO YEARS A SILLY TIME
TO MAKE PRESCRIPTION FOR A KINGDOMS WORTH 
WHY WARWICK CANST THOU SPEAK AGAINST THY LIEGE
WHOM THOU OBEYEDST THIRTY AND SIX YEARS
AND NOT BEWRAY THY TREASON WITH A BLUSH
CAN OXFORD THAT DID EVER FENCE THE RIGHT
NOW BUCKLER FALSEHOOD WITH A PEDIGREE
FOR SHAME  LEAVE HENRY AND CALL EDWARD KING 
CALL HIM MY KING BY WHOSE INJURIOUS DOOM
MY ELDER BROTHER THE LORD AUBREY VERE
WAS DONE TO DEATH AND MORE THAN SO MY FATHER
EVEN IN THE DOWNFALL OF HIS MELLOWD YEARS
WHEN NATURE BROUGHT HIM TO THE DOOR OF DEATH
NO WARWICK NO WHILE LIFE UPHOLDS THIS ARM
THIS ARM UPHOLDS THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER 
AND I THE HOUSE OF YORK 
QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD AND OXFORD
VOUCHSAFE AT OUR REQUEST TO STAND ASIDE
WHILE I USE FURTHER CONFERENCE WITH WARWICK 
HEAVENS GRANT THAT WARWICKS WORDS BEWITCH HIM NOT 
NOW WARWICK TELL ME EVEN UPON THY CONSCIENCE
IS EDWARD YOUR TRUE KING FOR I WERE LOATH
TO LINK WITH HIM THAT WERE NOT LAWFUL CHOSEN 
THEREON I PAWN MY CREDIT AND MINE HONOUR 
BUT IS HE GRACIOUS IN THE PEOPLES EYE
THE MORE THAT HENRY WAS UNFORTUNATE 
THEN FURTHER ALL DISSEMBLING SET ASIDE
TELL ME FOR TRUTH THE MEASURE OF HIS LOVE
UNTO OUR SISTER BONA 
SUCH IT SEEMS
AS MAY BESEEM A MONARCH LIKE HIMSELF 
MYSELF HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM SAY AND SWEAR
THAT THIS HIS LOVE WAS AN ETERNAL PLANT
WHEREOF THE ROOT WAS FIXD IN VIRTUES GROUND
THE LEAVES AND FRUIT MAINTAIND WITH BEAUTYS SUN
EXEMPT FROM ENVY BUT NOT FROM DISDAIN
UNLESS THE LADY BONA QUIT HIS PAIN 
NOW SISTER LET US HEAR YOUR FIRM RESOLVE 
YOUR GRANT OR YOUR DENIAL SHALL BE MINE
YET I CONFESS THAT OFTEN ERE THIS DAY
WHEN I HAVE HEARD YOUR KINGS DESERT RECOUNTED
MINE EAR HATH TEMPTED JUDGMENT TO DESIRE 
THEN WARWICK THUS OUR SISTER SHALL BE EDWARDS
AND NOW FORTHWITH SHALL ARTICLES BE DRAWN
TOUCHING THE JOINTURE THAT YOUR KING MUST MAKE
WHICH WITH HER DOWRY SHALL BE COUNTERPOISED 
DRAW NEAR QUEEN MARGARET AND BE A WITNESS
THAT BONA SHALL BE WIFE TO THE ENGLISH KING 
TO EDWARD BUT NOT TO THE ENGLISH KING 
DECEITFUL WARWICK  IT WAS THY DEVICE
BY THIS ALLIANCE TO MAKE VOID MY SUIT
BEFORE THY COMING LEWIS WAS HENRYS FRIEND 
AND STILL IS FRIEND TO HIM AND MARGARET
BUT IF YOUR TITLE TO THE CROWN BE WEAK
AS MAY APPEAR BY EDWARDS GOOD SUCCESS
THEN TIS BUT REASON THAT I BE RELEASED
FROM GIVING AID WHICH LATE I PROMISED 
YET SHALL YOU HAVE ALL KINDNESS AT MY HAND
THAT YOUR ESTATE REQUIRES AND MINE CAN YIELD 
HENRY NOW LIVES IN SCOTLAND AT HIS EASE
WHERE HAVING NOTHING NOTHING CAN HE LOSE 
AND AS FOR YOU YOURSELF OUR QUONDAM QUEEN
YOU HAVE A FATHER ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOU
AND BETTER TWERE YOU TROUBLED HIM THAN FRANCE 
PEACE IMPUDENT AND SHAMELESS WARWICK PEACE
PROUD SETTER UP AND PULLER DOWN OF KINGS 
I WILL NOT HENCE TILL WITH MY TALK AND TEARS

KING LEWIS I HERE PROTEST IN SIGHT OF HEAVEN
AND BY THE HOPE I HAVE OF HEAVENLY BLISS
THAT I AM CLEAR FROM THIS MISDEED OF EDWARDS
NO MORE MY KING FOR HE DISHONOURS ME
BUT MOST HIMSELF IF HE COULD SEE HIS SHAME 
DID I FORGET THAT BY THE HOUSE OF YORK
MY FATHER CAME UNTIMELY TO HIS DEATH
DID I LET PASS THE ABUSE DONE TO MY NIECE
DID I IMPALE HIM WITH THE REGAL CROWN
DID I PUT HENRY FROM HIS NATIVE RIGHT
AND AM I GUERDOND AT THE LAST WITH SHAME

SO MUCH HIS FRIEND AY HIS UNFEIGNED FRIEND
THAT IF KING LEWIS VOUCHSAFE TO FURNISH US

ILL UNDERTAKE TO LAND THEM ON OUR COAST
AND FORCE THE TYRANT FROM HIS SEAT BY WAR 
TIS NOT HIS NEWMADE BRIDE SHALL SUCCOR HIM
AND AS FOR CLARENCE AS MY LETTERS TELL ME
HES VERY LIKELY NOW TO FALL FROM HIM
FOR MATCHING MORE FOR WANTON LUST THAN HONOUR
OR THAN FOR STRENGTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COUNTRY 
DEAR BROTHER HOW SHALL BONA BE REVENGED

NOW TELL ME BROTHER CLARENCE WHAT THINK YOU
OF THIS NEW MARRIAGE WITH THE LADY GREY
HATH NOT OUR BROTHER MADE A WORTHY CHOICE
ALAS YOU KNOW TIS FAR FROM HENCE TO FRANCE
HOW COULD HE STAY TILL WARWICK MADE RETURN
MY LORDS FORBEAR THIS TALK HERE COMES THE KING 
AND HIS WELLCHOSEN BRIDE 
I MIND TO TELL HIM PLAINLY WHAT I THINK 
NOW BROTHER OF CLARENCE HOW LIKE YOU OUR CHOICE
THAT YOU STAND PENSIVE AS HALF MALCONTENT
AS WELL AS LEWIS OF FRANCE OR THE EARL OF WARWICK
WHICH ARE SO WEAK OF COURAGE AND IN JUDGMENT
THAT THEYLL TAKE NO OFFENCE AT OUR ABUSE 
SUPPOSE THEY TAKE OFFENCE WITHOUT A CAUSE
THEY ARE BUT LEWIS AND WARWICK I AM EDWARD
YOUR KING AND WARWICKS AND MUST HAVE MY WILL 
AND SHALL HAVE YOUR WILL BECAUSE OUR KING
YET HASTY MARRIAGE SELDOM PROVETH WELL 
YEA BROTHER RICHARD ARE YOU OFFENDED TOO
NOT I
NO GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD WISH THEM SEVERD
WHOM GOD HATH JOIND TOGETHER AY AND TWERE PITY
TO SUNDER THEM THAT YOKE SO WELL TOGETHER 
SETTING YOUR SCORNS AND YOUR MISLIKE ASIDE
TELL ME SOME REASON WHY THE LADY GREY
SHOULD NOT BECOME MY WIFE AND ENGLANDS QUEEN 
AND YOU TOO SOMERSET AND MONTAGUE
SPEAK FREELY WHAT YOU THINK 
THEN THIS IS MINE OPINION THAT KING LEWIS
BECOMES YOUR ENEMY FOR MOCKING HIM
ABOUT THE MARRIAGE OF THE LADY BONA 
AND WARWICK DOING WHAT YOU GAVE IN CHARGE
IS NOW DISHONOURED BY THIS NEW MARRIAGE 
WHAT IF BOTH LEWIS AND WARWICK BE APPEASED
BY SUCH INVENTION AS I CAN DEVISE
YET TO HAVE JOIND WITH FRANCE IN SUCH ALLIANCE
WOULD MORE HAVE STRENGTHEND THIS OUR COMMONWEALTH
GAINST FOREIGN STORMS THAN ANY HOMEBRED MARRIAGE 
WHY KNOWS NOT MONTAGUE THAT OF ITSELF
ENGLAND IS SAFE IF TRUE WITHIN ITSELF
BUT THE SAFER WHEN TIS BACKD WITH FRANCE 
TIS BETTER USING FRANCE THAN TRUSTING FRANCE
LET US BE BACKD WITH GOD AND WITH THE SEAS
WHICH HE HATH GIVEN FOR FENCE IMPREGNABLE
AND WITH THEIR HELPS ONLY DEFEND OURSELVES
IN THEM AND IN OURSELVES OUR SAFETY LIES 
FOR THIS ONE SPEECH LORD HASTINGS WELL DESERVES
TO HAVE THE HEIR OF THE LORD HUNGERFORD 
AY WHAT OF THAT IT WAS MY WILL AND GRANT
AND FOR THIS ONCE MY WILL SHALL STAND FOR LAW 
AND YET METHINKS YOUR GRACE HATH NOT DONE WELL
TO GIVE THE HEIR AND DAUGHTER OF LORD SCALES
UNTO THE BROTHER OF YOUR LOVING BRIDE
SHE BETTER WOULD HAVE FITTED ME OR CLARENCE
BUT IN YOUR BRIDE YOU BURY BROTHERHOOD 
OR ELSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BESTOWD THE HEIR
OF THE LORD BONVILLE ON YOUR NEW WIFES SON
AND LEAVE YOUR BROTHERS TO GO SPEED ELSEWHERE 
ALAS POOR CLARENCE  IS IT FOR A WIFE
THAT THOU ART MALCONTENT I WILL PROVIDE THEE 
IN CHOOSING FOR YOURSELF YOU SHOWD YOUR JUDGMENT
WHICH BEING SHALLOW YOU GIVE ME LEAVE
TO PLAY THE BROKER IN MINE OWN BEHALF
AND TO THAT END I SHORTLY MIND TO LEAVE YOU 
LEAVE ME OR TARRY EDWARD WILL BE KING
AND NOT BE TIED UNTO HIS BROTHERS WILL 
MY LORDS BEFORE IT PLEASED HIS MAJESTY
TO RAISE MY STATE TO TITLE OF A QUEEN
DO ME BUT RIGHT AND YOU MUST ALL CONFESS
THAT I WAS NOT IGNOBLE OF DESCENT
AND MEANER THAN MYSELF HAVE HAD LIKE FORTUNE 
BUT AS THIS TITLE HONOURS ME AND MINE
SO YOUR DISLIKE TO WHOM I WOULD BE PLEASING
DOTH CLOUD MY JOYS WITH DANGER AND WITH SORROW 
MY LOVE FORBEAR TO FAWN UPON THEIR FROWNS
WHAT DANGER OR WHAT SORROW CAN BEFALL THEE
SO LONG AS EDWARD IS THY CONSTANT FRIEND
AND THEIR TRUE SOVEREIGN WHOM THEY MUST OBEY
NAY WHOM THEY SHALL OBEY AND LOVE THEE TOO
UNLESS THEY SEEK FOR HATRED AT MY HANDS
WHICH IF THEY DO YET WILL I KEEP THEE SAFE
AND THEY SHALL FEEL THE VENGEANCE OF MY WRATH 
  I HEAR YET SAY NOT MUCH BUT THINK THE MORE 
NOW MESSENGER WHAT LETTERS OR WHAT NEWS
FROM FRANCE
MY SOVEREIGN LIEGE NO LETTERS AND FEW WORDS
BUT SUCH AS I WITHOUT YOUR SPECIAL PARDON
DARE NOT RELATE 
GO TO WE PARDON THEE THEREFORE IN BRIEF
TELL ME THEIR WORDS AS NEAR AS THOU CANST GUESS THEM 
WHAT ANSWER MAKES KING LEWIS UNTO OUR LETTERS
AT MY DEPART THESE WERE HIS VERY WORDS
GO TELL FALSE EDWARD THY SUPPOSED KING
THAT LEWIS OF FRANCE IS SENDING OVER MASQUERS
TO REVEL IT WITH HIM AND HIS NEW BRIDE 
IS LEWIS SO BRAVE BELIKE HE THINKS ME HENRY 
BUT WHAT SAID LADY BONA TO MY MARRIAGE
THESE WERE HER WORDS UTTERD WITH MAD DISDAIN
TELL HIM IN HOPE HELL PROVE A WIDOWER SHORTLY
ILL WEAR THE WILLOW GARLAND FOR HIS SAKE 
I BLAME NOT HER SHE COULD SAY LITTLE LESS
SHE HAD THE WRONG  BUT WHAT SAID HENRYS QUEEN
FOR I HAVE HEARD THAT SHE WAS THERE IN PLACE 
TELL HIM QUOTH SHE MY MOURNING WEEDS ARE DONE
AND I AM READY TO PUT ARMOUR ON 
BELIKE SHE MINDS TO PLAY THE AMAZON 
BUT WHAT SAID WARWICK TO THESE INJURIES
HE MORE INCENSED AGAINST YOUR MAJESTY
THAN ALL THE REST DISCHARGED ME WITH THESE WORDS
TELL HIM FROM ME THAT HE HATH DONE ME WRONG
AND THEREFORE ILL UNCROWN HIM ERET BE LONG 
HA  DURST THE TRAITOR BREATHE OUT SO PROUD WORDS
WELL I WILL ARM ME BEING THUS FOREWARND
THEY SHALL HAVE WARS AND PAY FOR THEIR PRESUMPTION 
BUT SAY IS WARWICK FRIENDS WITH MARGARET
AY GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN THEY ARE SO LINKD IN
FRIENDSHIP
THAT YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD MARRIES WARWICKS DAUGHTER 
BELIKE THE ELDER CLARENCE WILL HAVE THE YOUNGER 
NOW BROTHER KING FAREWELL AND SIT YOU FAST
FOR I WILL HENCE TO WARWICKS OTHER DAUGHTER
THAT THOUGH I WANT A KINGDOM YET IN MARRIAGE
I MAY NOT PROVE INFERIOR TO YOURSELF

PEMBROKE AND STAFFORD YOU IN OUR BEHALF

SO GOD HELP MONTAGUE AS HE PROVES TRUE 
AND HASTINGS AS HE FAVOURS EDWARDS CAUSE 
NOW BROTHER RICHARD WILL YOU STAND BY US
AY IN DESPITE OF ALL THAT SHALL WITHSTAND YOU 
WHY SO  THEN AM I SURE OF VICTORY 
NOW THEREFORE LET US HENCE AND LOSE NO HOUR
TILL WE MEET WARWICK WITH HIS FOREIGN POWER 
 KING HENRY VI

BUT SEE WHERE SOMERSET AND CLARENCE COME 
SPEAK SUDDENLY MY LORDS ARE WE ALL FRIENDS
FEAR NOT THAT MY LORD 
THEN GENTLE CLARENCE WELCOME UNTO WARWICK
AND WELCOME SOMERSET I HOLD IT COWARDICE
TO REST MISTRUSTFUL WHERE A NOBLE HEART
HATH PAWND AN OPEN HAND IN SIGN OF LOVE
ELSE MIGHT I THINK THAT CLARENCE EDWARDS BROTHER
WERE BUT A FEIGNED FRIEND TO OUR PROCEEDINGS
BUT WELCOME SWEET CLARENCE MY DAUGHTER SHALL BE THINE 
AND NOW WHAT RESTS BUT IN NIGHTS COVERTURE
THY BROTHER BEING CARELESSLY ENCAMPD
HIS SOLDIERS LURKING IN THE TOWNS ABOUT
AND BUT ATTENDED BY A SIMPLE GUARD
WE MAY SURPRISE AND TAKE HIM AT OUR PLEASURE
OUR SCOUTS HAVE FOUND THE ADVENTURE VERY EASY
THAT AS ULYSSES AND STOUT DIOMEDE
WITH SLEIGHT AND MANHOOD STOLE TO RHESUS TENTS
AND BROUGHT FROM THENCE THE THRACIAN FATAL STEEDS
SO WE WELL COVERD WITH THE NIGHTS BLACK MANTLE
AT UNAWARES MAY BEAT DOWN EDWARDS GUARD
AND SEIZE HIMSELF I SAY NOT SLAUGHTER HIM
FOR I INTEND BUT ONLY TO SURPRISE HIM 
YOU THAT WILL FOLLOW ME TO THIS ATTEMPT
APPLAUD THE NAME OF HENRY WITH YOUR LEADER 
WHY THEN LETS ON OUR WAY IN SILENT SORT
FOR WARWICK AND HIS FRIENDS GOD AND SAINT GEORGE 
 KING HENRY VI
COME ON MY MASTERS EACH MAN TAKE HIS STAND
THE KING BY THIS IS SET HIM DOWN TO SLEEP 
WHAT WILL HE NOT TO BED
WHY NO FOR HE HATH MADE A SOLEMN VOW
NEVER TO LIE AND TAKE HIS NATURAL REST
TILL WARWICK OR HIMSELF BE QUITE SUPPRESSD 
TOMORROW THEN BELIKE SHALL BE THE DAY
IF WARWICK BE SO NEAR AS MEN REPORT 
BUT SAY I PRAY WHAT NOBLEMAN IS THAT
THAT WITH THE KING HERE RESTETH IN HIS TENT
TIS THE LORD HASTINGS THE KINGS CHIEFEST FRIEND 
O IS IT SO BUT WHY COMMANDS THE KING
THAT HIS CHIEF FOLLOWERS LODGE IN TOWNS ABOUT HIM
WHILE HE HIMSELF KEEPS IN THE COLD FIELD
TIS THE MORE HONOUR BECAUSE MORE DANGEROUS 
AY BUT GIVE ME WORSHIP AND QUIETNESS
I LIKE IT BETTER THAN A DANGEROUS HONOUR 
IF WARWICK KNEW IN WHAT ESTATE HE STANDS
TIS TO BE DOUBTED HE WOULD WAKEN HIM 
UNLESS OUR HALBERDS DID SHUT UP HIS PASSAGE 
AY WHEREFORE ELSE GUARD WE HIS ROYAL TENT
BUT TO DEFEND HIS PERSON FROM NIGHTFOES
THIS IS HIS TENT AND SEE WHERE STAND HIS GUARD 
COURAGE MY MASTERS  HONOUR NOW OR NEVER 
BUT FOLLOW ME AND EDWARD SHALL BE OURS 
WHO GOES THERE
STAY OR THOU DIEST

AY BUT THE CASE IS ALTERD
WHEN YOU DISGRACED ME IN MY EMBASSADE
THEN I DEGRADED YOU FROM BEING KING
AND COME NOW TO CREATE YOU DUKE OF YORK 
ALAS  HOW SHOULD YOU GOVERN ANY KINGDOM
THAT KNOW NOT HOW TO USE AMBASSADORS
NOR HOW TO BE CONTENTED WITH ONE WIFE
NOR HOW TO USE YOUR BROTHERS BROTHERLY

YEA BROTHER OF CLARENCE ARE THOU HERE TOO
NAY THEN I SEE THAT EDWARD NEEDS MUST DOWN 
YET WARWICK IN DESPITE OF ALL MISCHANCE
OF THEE THYSELF AND ALL THY COMPLICES
EDWARD WILL ALWAYS BEAR HIMSELF AS KING

THEN FOR HIS MIND BE EDWARD ENGLANDS KING
BUT HENRY NOW SHALL WEAR THE ENGLISH CROWN
AND BE TRUE KING INDEED THOU BUT THE SHADOW 
MY LORD OF SOMERSET AT MY REQUEST
SEE THAT FORTHWITH DUKE EDWARD BE CONVEYD
UNTO MY BROTHER ARCHBISHOP OF YORK 
WHEN I HAVE FOUGHT WITH PEMBROKE AND HIS FELLOWS

TO FREE KING HENRY FROM IMPRISONMENT
AND SEE HIM SEATED IN THE REGAL THRONE 
 KING HENRY VI
MADAM WHAT MAKES YOU IN THIS SUDDEN CHANGE

THAT I MUST YIELD MY BODY TO THE EARTH
AND BY MY FALL THE CONQUEST TO MY FOE 
THUS YIELDS THE CEDAR TO THE AXES EDGE
WHOSE ARMS GAVE SHELTER TO THE PRINCELY EAGLE
UNDER WHOSE SHADE THE RAMPING LION SLEPT
WHOSE TOPBRANCH OVERPEERD JOVES SPREADING TREE
AND KEPT LOW SHRUBS FROM WINTERS POWERFUL WIND 
THESE EYES THAT NOW ARE DIMMD WITH DEATHS BLACK VEIL
HAVE BEEN AS PIERCING AS THE MIDDAY SUN
TO SEARCH THE SECRET TREASONS OF THE WORLD
THE WRINKLES IN MY BROWS NOW FILLED WITH BLOOD
WERE LIKEND OFT TO KINGLY SEPULCHRES
FOR WHO LIVED KING BUT I COULD DIG HIS GRAVE
AND WHO DURST MINE WHEN WARWICK BENT HIS BROW
LO NOW MY GLORY SMEARD IN DUST AND BLOOD 
MY PARKS MY WALKS MY MANORS THAT I HAD 
EVEN NOW FORSAKE ME AND OF ALL MY LANDS

COME QUICKLY MONTAGUE OR I AM DEAD 
AH WARWICK  MONTAGUE HATH BREATHED HIS LAST
AND TO THE LATEST GASP CRIED OUT FOR WARWICK
AND SAID COMMEND ME TO MY VALIANT BROTHER

ERE HE ATTAIN HIS EASEFUL WESTERN BED
I MEAN MY LORDS THOSE POWERS THAT THE QUEEN
HATH RAISED IN GALLIA HAVE ARRIVED OUR COAST
AND AS WE HEAR MARCH ON TO FIGHT WITH US 
A LITTLE GALE WILL SOON DISPERSE THAT CLOUD
AND BLOW IT TO THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE IT CAME
THE VERY BEAMS WILL DRY THOSE VAPOURS UP
FOR EVERY CLOUD ENGENDERS NOT A STORM 
THE QUEEN IS VALUED THIRTY THOUSAND STRONG
AND SOMERSET WITH OXFORD FLED TO HER
IF SHE HAVE TIME TO BREATHE BE WELL ASSURED
HER FACTION WILL BE FULL AS STRONG AS OURS 
WE ARE ADVERTISED BY OUR LOVING FRIENDS

IN EVERY COUNTY AS WE GO ALONG 
STRIKE UP THE DRUM CRY COURAGE  AND AWAY 
 KING HENRY VI

YET LIVES OUR PILOT STILL  IST MEET THAT HE
SHOULD LEAVE THE HELM AND LIKE A FEARFUL LAD
WITH TEARFUL EYES ADD WATER TO THE SEA
AND GIVE MORE STRENGTH TO THAT WHICH HATH TOO MUCH

AND THOUGH UNSKILFUL WHY NOT NED AND I
FOR ONCE ALLOWD THE SKILFUL PILOTS CHARGE
WE WILL NOT FROM THE HELM TO SIT AND WEEP
BUT KEEP OUR COURSE THOUGH THE ROUGH WIND SAY NO
FROM SHELVES AND ROCKS THAT THREATEN US WITH WRECK 
AS GOOD TO CHIDE THE WAVES AS SPEAK THEM FAIR 
AND WHAT IS EDWARD BUT RUTHLESS SEA

LEST IN OUR NEED HE MIGHT INFECT ANOTHER

IF ANY SUCH BE HERE AS GOD FORBID  
LET HIM DEPART BEFORE WE NEED HIS HELP 
WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF SO HIGH A COURAGE
AND WARRIORS FAINT  WHY TWERE PERPETUAL SHAME
