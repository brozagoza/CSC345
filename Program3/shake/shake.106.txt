YOU DO NOT MEET A MAN BUT FROWNS OUR BLOODS
NO MORE OBEY THE HEAVENS THAN OUR COURTIERS
STILL SEEM AS DOES THE KING 
BUT WHATS THE MATTER
HIS DAUGHTER AND THE HEIR OFS KINGDOM WHOM
HE PURPOSED TO HIS WIFES SOLE SON A WIDOW
THAT LATE HE MARRIED HATH REFERRD HERSELF
UNTO A POOR BUT WORTHY GENTLEMAN SHES WEDDED
HER HUSBAND BANISHD SHE IMPRISOND ALL
IS OUTWARD SORROW THOUGH I THINK THE KING
BE TOUCHD AT VERY HEART 
NONE BUT THE KING
HE THAT HATH LOST HER TOO SO IS THE QUEEN
THAT MOST DESIRED THE MATCH BUT NOT A COURTIER
ALTHOUGH THEY WEAR THEIR FACES TO THE BENT
OF THE KINGS LOOKS HATH A HEART THAT IS NOT
GLAD AT THE THING THEY SCOWL AT 
AND WHY SO
HE THAT HATH MISSD THE PRINCESS IS A THING
TOO BAD FOR BAD REPORT AND HE THAT HATH HER 
I MEAN THAT MARRIED HER ALACK GOOD MAN 
AND THEREFORE BANISHD IS A CREATURE SUCH
AS TO SEEK THROUGH THE REGIONS OF THE EARTH
FOR ONE HIS LIKE THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING FAILING
IN HIM THAT SHOULD COMPARE  I DO NOT THINK
SO FAIR AN OUTWARD AND SUCH STUFF WITHIN
ENDOWS A MAN BUT HE 
YOU SPEAK HIM FAR 
I DO EXTEND HIM SIR WITHIN HIMSELF
CRUSH HIM TOGETHER RATHER THAN UNFOLD
HIS MEASURE DULY 
WHATS HIS NAME AND BIRTH
I CANNOT DELVE HIM TO THE ROOT HIS FATHER
WAS CALLD SICILIUS WHO DID JOIN HIS HONOUR
AGAINST THE ROMANS WITH CASSIBELAN
BUT HAD HIS TITLES BY TENANTIUS WHOM
HE SERVED WITH GLORY AND ADMIRED SUCCESS
SO GAIND THE SURADDITION LEONATUS
AND HAD BESIDES THIS GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION
TWO OTHER SONS WHO IN THE WARS O THE TIME
DIED WITH THEIR SWORDS IN HAND FOR WHICH
THEIR FATHER
THEN OLD AND FOND OF ISSUE TOOK SUCH SORROW
THAT HE QUIT BEING AND HIS GENTLE LADY
BIG OF THIS GENTLEMAN OUR THEME DECEASED
AS HE WAS BORN  THE KING HE TAKES THE BABE
TO HIS PROTECTION CALLS HIM POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
BREEDS HIM AND MAKES HIM OF HIS BEDCHAMBER
PUTS TO HIM ALL THE LEARNINGS THAT HIS TIME
COULD MAKE HIM THE RECEIVER OF WHICH HE TOOK
AS WE DO AIR FAST AS TWAS MINISTERD
AND INS SPRING BECAME A HARVEST LIVED IN COURT 
WHICH RARE IT IS TO DO MOST PRAISED MOST LOVED
A SAMPLE TO THE YOUNGEST TO THE MORE MATURE
A GLASS THAT FEATED THEM AND TO THE GRAVER
A CHILD THAT GUIDED DOTARDS TO HIS MISTRESS
FOR WHOM HE NOW IS BANISHD HER OWN PRICE
PROCLAIMS HOW SHE ESTEEMD HIM AND HIS VIRTUE
BY HER ELECTION MAY BE TRULY READ
WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS 
I HONOUR HIM
EVEN OUT OF YOUR REPORT  BUT PRAY YOU TELL ME
IS SHE SOLE CHILD TO THE KING
HIS ONLY CHILD 
HE HAD TWO SONS IF THIS BE WORTH YOUR HEARING
MARK IT THE ELDEST OF THEM AT THREE YEARS OLD

WERE STOLN AND TO THIS HOUR NO GUESS IN KNOWLEDGE
WHICH WAY THEY WENT

THAT HE SPAKE TO THEE
IT WAS HIS QUEEN HIS QUEEN 
THEN WAVED HIS HANDKERCHIEF
AND KISSD IT MADAM 
SENSELESS LINEN  HAPPIER THEREIN THAN I 
AND THAT WAS ALL
NO MADAM FOR SO LONG
AS HE COULD MAKE ME WITH THIS EYE OR EAR
DISTINGUISH HIM FROM OTHERS HE DID KEEP
THE DECK WITH GLOVE OR HAT OR HANDKERCHIEF
STILL WAVING AS THE FITS AND STIRS OF S MIND

HOW SWIFT HIS SHIP 
THOU SHOULDST HAVE MADE HIM
AS LITTLE AS A CROW OR LESS ERE LEFT
TO AFTEREYE HIM 
MADAM SO I DID 
I WOULD HAVE BROKE MINE EYESTRINGS CRACKD THEM BUT
TO LOOK UPON HIM TILL THE DIMINUTION
OF SPACE HAD POINTED HIM SHARP AS MY NEEDLE
NAY FOLLOWD HIM TILL HE HAD MELTED FROM
THE SMALLNESS OF A GNAT TO AIR AND THEN
HAVE TURND MINE EYE AND WEPT  BUT GOOD PISANIO
WHEN SHALL WE HEAR FROM HIM
BE ASSURED MADAM
WITH HIS NEXT VANTAGE 
I DID NOT TAKE MY LEAVE OF HIM BUT HAD
MOST PRETTY THINGS TO SAY ERE I COULD TELL HIM
HOW I WOULD THINK ON HIM AT CERTAIN HOURS
SUCH THOUGHTS AND SUCH OR I COULD MAKE HIM SWEAR
THE SHES OF ITALY SHOULD NOT BETRAY
MINE INTEREST AND HIS HONOUR OR HAVE CHARGED HIM
AT THE SIXTH HOUR OF MORN AT NOON AT MIDNIGHT
TO ENCOUNTER ME WITH ORISONS FOR THEN
I AM IN HEAVEN FOR HIM OR ERE I COULD
GIVE HIM THAT PARTING KISS WHICH I HAD SET
BETWIXT TWO CHARMING WORDS COMES IN MY FATHER
AND LIKE THE TYRANNOUS BREATHING OF THE NORTH
SHAKES ALL OUR BUDS FROM GROWING 
THE QUEEN MADAM
DESIRES YOUR HIGHNESS COMPANY 
THOSE THINGS I BID YOU DO GET THEM DISPATCHD 
I WILL ATTEND THE QUEEN 
MADAM I SHALL 
BELIEVE IT SIR I HAVE SEEN HIM IN BRITAIN HE WAS
THEN OF A CRESCENT NOTE EXPECTED TO PROVE SO WORTHY
AS SINCE HE HATH BEEN ALLOWED THE NAME OF BUT I
COULD THEN HAVE LOOKED ON HIM WITHOUT THE HELP OF
ADMIRATION THOUGH THE CATALOGUE OF HIS ENDOWMENTS
HAD BEEN TABLED BY HIS SIDE AND I TO PERUSE HIM BY ITEMS 
YOU SPEAK OF HIM WHEN HE WAS LESS FURNISHED THAN NOW
HE IS WITH THAT WHICH MAKES HIM BOTH WITHOUT AND WITHIN 
I HAVE SEEN HIM IN FRANCE WE HAD VERY MANY THERE
COULD BEHOLD THE SUN WITH AS FIRM EYES AS HE 
THIS MATTER OF MARRYING HIS KINGS DAUGHTER WHEREIN
HE MUST BE WEIGHED RATHER BY HER VALUE THAN HIS OWN
WORDS HIM I DOUBT NOT A GREAT DEAL FROM THE MATTER 
AND THEN HIS BANISHMENT 
AY AND THE APPROBATION OF THOSE THAT WEEP THIS
LAMENTABLE DIVORCE UNDER HER COLOURS ARE WONDERFULLY
TO EXTEND HIM BE IT BUT TO FORTIFY HER JUDGMENT
WHICH ELSE AN EASY BATTERY MIGHT LAY FLAT FOR
TAKING A BEGGAR WITHOUT LESS QUALITY  BUT HOW COMES
IT HE IS TO SOJOURN WITH YOU HOW CREEPS
ACQUAINTANCE
HIS FATHER AND I WERE SOLDIERS TOGETHER TO WHOM I
HAVE BEEN OFTEN BOUND FOR NO LESS THAN MY LIFE 
HERE COMES THE BRITON LET HIM BE SO ENTERTAINED
AMONGST YOU AS SUITS WITH GENTLEMEN OF YOUR
KNOWING TO A STRANGER OF HIS QUALITY 
I BESEECH YOU ALL BE BETTER KNOWN TO THIS
GENTLEMAN WHOM I COMMEND TO YOU AS A NOBLE FRIEND
OF MINE HOW WORTHY HE IS I WILL LEAVE TO APPEAR
HEREAFTER RATHER THAN STORY HIM IN HIS OWN HEARING 
SIR WE HAVE KNOWN TOGETHER IN ORLEANS 
SINCE WHEN I HAVE BEEN DEBTOR TO YOU FOR COURTESIES
WHICH I WILL BE EVER TO PAY AND YET PAY STILL 
SIR YOU OERRATE MY POOR KINDNESS I WAS GLAD I
DID ATONE MY COUNTRYMAN AND YOU IT HAD BEEN PITY
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER WITH SO MORTAL A
PURPOSE AS THEN EACH BORE UPON IMPORTANCE OF SO
SLIGHT AND TRIVIAL A NATURE 
BY YOUR PARDON SIR I WAS THEN A YOUNG TRAVELLER
RATHER SHUNNED TO GO EVEN WITH WHAT I HEARD THAN IN
MY EVERY ACTION TO BE GUIDED BY OTHERS EXPERIENCES
BUT UPON MY MENDED JUDGMENT IF I OFFEND NOT TO SAY
IT IS MENDED MY QUARREL WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SLIGHT 
FAITH YES TO BE PUT TO THE ARBITREMENT OF SWORDS
AND BY SUCH TWO THAT WOULD BY ALL LIKELIHOOD HAVE
CONFOUNDED ONE THE OTHER OR HAVE FALLEN BOTH 
CAN WE WITH MANNERS ASK WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE
SAFELY I THINK TWAS A CONTENTION IN PUBLIC
WHICH MAY WITHOUT CONTRADICTION SUFFER THE REPORT 
IT WAS MUCH LIKE AN ARGUMENT THAT FELL OUT LAST
NIGHT WHERE EACH OF US FELL IN PRAISE OF OUR
COUNTRY MISTRESSES THIS GENTLEMAN AT THAT TIME
VOUCHING AND UPON WARRANT OF BLOODY
AFFIRMATION HIS TO BE MORE FAIR VIRTUOUS WISE
CHASTE CONSTANTQUALIFIED AND LESS ATTEMPTABLE
THAN ANY THE RAREST OF OUR LADIES IN FRANCE 
THAT LADY IS NOT NOW LIVING OR THIS GENTLEMANS
OPINION BY THIS WORN OUT 
SHE HOLDS HER VIRTUE STILL AND I MY MIND 
YOU MUST NOT SO FAR PREFER HER FORE OURS OF ITALY 
BEING SO FAR PROVOKED AS I WAS IN FRANCE I WOULD
ABATE HER NOTHING THOUGH I PROFESS MYSELF HER
ADORER NOT HER FRIEND 
AS FAIR AND AS GOOD A KIND OF HANDINHAND
COMPARISON HAD BEEN SOMETHING TOO FAIR AND TOO GOOD
FOR ANY LADY IN BRITAIN  IF SHE WENT BEFORE OTHERS
I HAVE SEEN AS THAT DIAMOND OF YOURS OUTLUSTRES
MANY I HAVE BEHELD  I COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE SHE
EXCELLED MANY BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOST
PRECIOUS DIAMOND THAT IS NOR YOU THE LADY 
I PRAISED HER AS I RATED HER SO DO I MY STONE 
WHAT DO YOU ESTEEM IT AT
MORE THAN THE WORLD ENJOYS 
EITHER YOUR UNPARAGONED MISTRESS IS DEAD OR SHES
OUTPRIZED BY A TRIFLE 
YOU ARE MISTAKEN THE ONE MAY BE SOLD OR GIVEN IF
THERE WERE WEALTH ENOUGH FOR THE PURCHASE OR MERIT
FOR THE GIFT THE OTHER IS NOT A THING FOR SALE
AND ONLY THE GIFT OF THE GODS 
WHICH THE GODS HAVE GIVEN YOU
WHICH BY THEIR GRACES I WILL KEEP 
YOU MAY WEAR HER IN TITLE YOURS BUT YOU KNOW
STRANGE FOWL LIGHT UPON NEIGHBOURING PONDS  YOUR
RING MAY BE STOLEN TOO SO YOUR BRACE OF UNPRIZABLE
ESTIMATIONS THE ONE IS BUT FRAIL AND THE OTHER
CASUAL A CUNNING THIEF OR A THAT WAY ACCOMPLISHED
COURTIER WOULD HAZARD THE WINNING BOTH OF FIRST AND LAST 
YOUR ITALY CONTAINS NONE SO ACCOMPLISHED A COURTIER
TO CONVINCE THE HONOUR OF MY MISTRESS IF IN THE
HOLDING OR LOSS OF THAT YOU TERM HER FRAIL  I DO

I DARE THEREUPON PAWN THE MOIETY OF MY ESTATE TO
YOUR RING WHICH IN MY OPINION OERVALUES IT
SOMETHING BUT I MAKE MY WAGER RATHER AGAINST YOUR
CONFIDENCE THAN HER REPUTATION AND TO BAR YOUR
OFFENCE HEREIN TOO I DURST ATTEMPT IT AGAINST ANY
LADY IN THE WORLD

PERSUASION AND I DOUBT NOT YOU SUSTAIN WHAT YOURE
WORTHY OF BY YOUR ATTEMPT

WHEN YOU ABOVE PERCEIVE ME LIKE A CROW
THAT IT IS PLACE WHICH LESSENS AND SETS OFF
AND YOU MAY THEN REVOLVE WHAT TALES I HAVE TOLD YOU
OF COURTS OF PRINCES OF THE TRICKS IN WAR
THIS SERVICE IS NOT SERVICE SO BEING DONE
BUT BEING SO ALLOWD TO APPREHEND THUS
DRAWS US A PROFIT FROM ALL THINGS WE SEE
AND OFTEN TO OUR COMFORT SHALL WE FIND
THE SHARDED BEETLE IN A SAFER HOLD
THAN IS THE FULLWINGD EAGLE  O THIS LIFE

A PRISON FOR A DEBTOR THAT NOT DARES
TO STRIDE A LIMIT 
WHAT SHOULD WE SPEAK OF
WHEN WE ARE OLD AS YOU WHEN WE SHALL HEAR
THE RAIN AND WIND BEAT DARK DECEMBER HOW
IN THIS OUR PINCHING CAVE SHALL WE DISCOURSE
THE FREEZING HOURS AWAY WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING
WE ARE BEASTLY SUBTLE AS THE FOX FOR PREY
LIKE WARLIKE AS THE WOLF FOR WHAT WE EAT
OUR VALOUR IS TO CHASE WHAT FLIES OUR CAGE
WE MAKE A QUIRE AS DOTH THE PRISOND BIRD
AND SING OUR BONDAGE FREELY 
HOW YOU SPEAK 
DID YOU BUT KNOW THE CITYS USURIES
AND FELT THEM KNOWINGLY THE ART O THE COURT
AS HARD TO LEAVE AS KEEP WHOSE TOP TO CLIMB
IS CERTAIN FALLING OR SO SLIPPERY THAT
THE FEARS AS BAD AS FALLING THE TOIL O THE WAR
A PAIN THAT ONLY SEEMS TO SEEK OUT DANGER
I THE NAME OF FAME AND HONOUR WHICH DIES I
THE SEARCH
AND HATH AS OFT A SLANDEROUS EPITAPH
AS RECORD OF FAIR ACT NAY MANY TIMES
DOTH ILL DESERVE BY DOING WELL WHATS WORSE
MUST COURTSY AT THE CENSURE O BOYS THIS STORY
THE WORLD MAY READ IN ME MY BODYS MARKD
WITH ROMAN SWORDS AND MY REPORT WAS ONCE
FIRST WITH THE BEST OF NOTE CYMBELINE LOVED ME

WHOSE BOUGHS DID BEND WITH FRUIT BUT IN ONE NIGHT
A STORM OR ROBBERY CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL
SHOOK DOWN MY MELLOW HANGINGS NAY MY LEAVES
AND LEFT ME BARE TO WEATHER 
UNCERTAIN FAVOUR 
MY FAULT BEING NOTHING AS I HAVE TOLD YOU OFT 
BUT THAT TWO VILLAINS WHOSE FALSE OATHS PREVAILD
BEFORE MY PERFECT HONOUR SWORE TO CYMBELINE
I WAS CONFEDERATE WITH THE ROMANS SO
FOLLOWD MY BANISHMENT AND THIS TWENTY YEARS

WHERE I HAVE LIVED AT HONEST FREEDOM PAID
MORE PIOUS DEBTS TO HEAVEN THAN IN ALL
THE FOREEND OF MY TIME  BUT UP TO THE MOUNTAINS 
THIS IS NOT HUNTERS LANGUAGE HE THAT STRIKES
THE VENISON FIRST SHALL BE THE LORD O THE FEAST
TO HIM THE OTHER TWO SHALL MINISTER
AND WE WILL FEAR NO POISON WHICH ATTENDS
IN PLACE OF GREATER STATE  ILL MEET YOU IN THE VALLEYS 
HOW HARD IT IS TO HIDE THE SPARKS OF NATURE 
THESE BOYS KNOW LITTLE THEY ARE SONS TO THE KING
NOR CYMBELINE DREAMS THAT THEY ARE ALIVE 
THEY THINK THEY ARE MINE AND THOUGH TRAIND
UP THUS MEANLY
I THE CAVE WHEREIN THEY BOW THEIR THOUGHTS DO HIT
THE ROOFS OF PALACES AND NATURE PROMPTS THEM
IN SIMPLE AND LOW THINGS TO PRINCE IT MUCH
BEYOND THE TRICK OF OTHERS  THIS POLYDORE

THE KING HIS FATHER CALLD GUIDERIUS JOVE 
WHEN ON MY THREEFOOT STOOL I SIT AND TELL
THE WARLIKE FEATS I HAVE DONE HIS SPIRITS FLY OUT
INTO MY STORY SAY THUS MINE ENEMY FELL
AND THUS I SET MY FOOT ON S NECK EVEN THEN
THE PRINCELY BLOOD FLOWS IN HIS CHEEK HE SWEATS
STRAINS HIS YOUNG NERVES AND PUTS HIMSELF IN POSTURE
THAT ACTS MY WORDS  THE YOUNGER BROTHER CADWAL
ONCE ARVIRAGUS IN AS LIKE A FIGURE
STRIKES LIFE INTO MY SPEECH AND SHOWS MUCH MORE
HIS OWN CONCEIVING  HARK THE GAME IS ROUSED 
O CYMBELINE  HEAVEN AND MY CONSCIENCE KNOWS

IF THAT THY GENTRY BRITAIN GO BEFORE
THIS LOUT AS HE EXCEEDS OUR LORDS THE ODDS

LETS REINFORCE OR FLY 
CAMEST THOU FROM WHERE THEY MADE THE STAND
I DID 
THOUGH YOU IT SEEMS COME FROM THE FLIERS 
I DID 
NO BLAME BE TO YOU SIR FOR ALL WAS LOST
BUT THAT THE HEAVENS FOUGHT THE KING HIMSELF
OF HIS WINGS DESTITUTE THE ARMY BROKEN
AND BUT THE BACKS OF BRITONS SEEN ALL FLYING
THROUGH A STRAIGHT LANE THE ENEMY FULLHEARTED
LOLLING THE TONGUE WITH SLAUGHTERING HAVING WORK
MORE PLENTIFUL THAN TOOLS TO DOT STRUCK DOWN
SOME MORTALLY SOME SLIGHTLY TOUCHD SOME FALLING
MERELY THROUGH FEAR THAT THE STRAIGHT PASS WAS DAMMD
WITH DEAD MEN HURT BEHIND AND COWARDS LIVING
TO DIE WITH LENGTHEND SHAME 
WHERE WAS THIS LANE
CLOSE BY THE BATTLE DITCHD AND WALLD WITH TURF
WHICH GAVE ADVANTAGE TO AN ANCIENT SOLDIER
AN HONEST ONE I WARRANT WHO DESERVED
SO LONG A BREEDING AS HIS WHITE BEARD CAME TO
IN DOING THIS FORS COUNTRY ATHWART THE LANE
HE WITH TWO STRIPLINGSLADS MORE LIKE TO RUN
THE COUNTRY BASE THAN TO COMMIT SUCH SLAUGHTER
WITH FACES FIT FOR MASKS OR RATHER FAIRER
THAN THOSE FOR PRESERVATION CASED OR SHAME 
MADE GOOD THE PASSAGE CRIED TO THOSE THAT FLED
OUR BRITAIN S HARTS DIE FLYING NOT OUR MEN
TO DARKNESS FLEET SOULS THAT FLY BACKWARDS  STAND
OR WE ARE ROMANS AND WILL GIVE YOU THAT
LIKE BEASTS WHICH YOU SHUN BEASTLY AND MAY SAVE
BUT TO LOOK BACK IN FROWN STAND STAND 
THESE THREE
THREE THOUSAND CONFIDENT IN ACT AS MANY 
FOR THREE PERFORMERS ARE THE FILE WHEN ALL
THE REST DO NOTHING WITH THIS WORD STAND STAND
ACCOMMODATED BY THE PLACE MORE CHARMING
WITH THEIR OWN NOBLENESS WHICH COULD HAVE TURND
A DISTAFF TO A LANCE GILDED PALE LOOKS
PART SHAME PART SPIRIT RENEWD THAT SOME
TURND COWARD
BUT BY EXAMPLE O A SIN IN WAR
DAMND IN THE FIRST BEGINNERS  GAN TO LOOK
THE WAY THAT THEY DID AND TO GRIN LIKE LIONS
UPON THE PIKES O THE HUNTERS  THEN BEGAN
A STOP I THE CHASER A RETIRE ANON
A ROUT CONFUSION THICK FORTHWITH THEY FLY
CHICKENS THE WAY WHICH THEY STOOPD EAGLES SLAVES
THE STRIDES THEY VICTORS MADE AND NOW OUR COWARDS
LIKE FRAGMENTS IN HARD VOYAGES BECAME
THE LIFE O THE NEED HAVING FOUND THE BACKDOOR OPEN
OF THE UNGUARDED HEARTS HEAVENS HOW THEY WOUND 
SOME SLAIN BEFORE SOME DYING SOME THEIR FRIENDS
OER BORNE I THE FORMER WAVE TEN CHASED BY ONE
ARE NOW EACH ONE THE SLAUGHTERMAN OF TWENTY
THOSE THAT WOULD DIE OR ERE RESIST ARE GROWN
THE MORTAL BUGS O THE FIELD 
THIS WAS STRANGE CHANCE
A NARROW LANE AN OLD MAN AND TWO BOYS
