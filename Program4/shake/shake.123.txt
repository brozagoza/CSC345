I LEARN IN THIS LETTER THAT DON PETER OF ARRAGON
COMES THIS NIGHT TO MESSINA 
HE IS VERY NEAR BY THIS HE WAS NOT THREE LEAGUES OFF
WHEN I LEFT HIM 
HOW MANY GENTLEMEN HAVE YOU LOST IN THIS ACTION
BUT FEW OF ANY SORT AND NONE OF NAME 
A VICTORY IS TWICE ITSELF WHEN THE ACHIEVER BRINGS
HOME FULL NUMBERS  I FIND HERE THAT DON PETER HATH
BESTOWED MUCH HONOUR ON A YOUNG FLORENTINE CALLED CLAUDIO 
MUCH DESERVED ON HIS PART AND EQUALLY REMEMBERED BY
DON PEDRO HE HATH BORNE HIMSELF BEYOND THE
PROMISE OF HIS AGE DOING IN THE FIGURE OF A LAMB
THE FEATS OF A LION HE HATH INDEED BETTER
BETTERED EXPECTATION THAN YOU MUST EXPECT OF ME TO
TELL YOU HOW 
HE HATH AN UNCLE HERE IN MESSINA WILL BE VERY MUCH
GLAD OF IT 
I HAVE ALREADY DELIVERED HIM LETTERS AND THERE
APPEARS MUCH JOY IN HIM EVEN SO MUCH THAT JOY COULD
NOT SHOW ITSELF MODEST ENOUGH WITHOUT A BADGE OF
BITTERNESS 
DID HE BREAK OUT INTO TEARS
IN GREAT MEASURE 
A KIND OVERFLOW OF KINDNESS THERE ARE NO FACES
TRUER THAN THOSE THAT ARE SO WASHED  HOW MUCH
BETTER IS IT TO WEEP AT JOY THAN TO JOY AT WEEPING 
I PRAY YOU IS SIGNIOR MOUNTANTO RETURNED FROM THE
WARS OR NO
I KNOW NONE OF THAT NAME LADY THERE WAS NONE SUCH
IN THE ARMY OF ANY SORT 
WHAT IS HE THAT YOU ASK FOR NIECE
MY COUSIN MEANS SIGNIOR BENEDICK OF PADUA 
O HES RETURNED AND AS PLEASANT AS EVER HE WAS 
HE SET UP HIS BILLS HERE IN MESSINA AND CHALLENGED
CUPID AT THE FLIGHT AND MY UNCLES FOOL READING
THE CHALLENGE SUBSCRIBED FOR CUPID AND CHALLENGED
HIM AT THE BIRDBOLT  I PRAY YOU HOW MANY HATH HE
KILLED AND EATEN IN THESE WARS BUT HOW MANY HATH
HE KILLED FOR INDEED I PROMISED TO EAT ALL OF HIS KILLING 
FAITH NIECE YOU TAX SIGNIOR BENEDICK TOO MUCH
BUT HELL BE MEET WITH YOU I DOUBT IT NOT 
HE HATH DONE GOOD SERVICE LADY IN THESE WARS 
YOU HAD MUSTY VICTUAL AND HE HATH HOLP TO EAT IT
HE IS A VERY VALIANT TRENCHERMAN HE HATH AN
EXCELLENT STOMACH 
AND A GOOD SOLDIER TOO LADY 
AND A GOOD SOLDIER TO A LADY BUT WHAT IS HE TO A LORD
A LORD TO A LORD A MAN TO A MAN STUFFED WITH ALL
HONOURABLE VIRTUES 
IT IS SO INDEED HE IS NO LESS THAN A STUFFED MAN
BUT FOR THE STUFFING WELL WE ARE ALL MORTAL 
YOU MUST NOT SIR MISTAKE MY NIECE  THERE IS A
KIND OF MERRY WAR BETWIXT SIGNIOR BENEDICK AND HER
THEY NEVER MEET BUT THERES A SKIRMISH OF WIT
BETWEEN THEM 
ALAS  HE GETS NOTHING BY THAT  IN OUR LAST
CONFLICT FOUR OF HIS FIVE WITS WENT HALTING OFF AND
NOW IS THE WHOLE MAN GOVERNED WITH ONE SO THAT IF
HE HAVE WIT ENOUGH TO KEEP HIMSELF WARM LET HIM
BEAR IT FOR A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS
HORSE FOR IT IS ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HATH LEFT
TO BE KNOWN A REASONABLE CREATURE  WHO IS HIS
COMPANION NOW HE HATH EVERY MONTH A NEW SWORN BROTHER 
IST POSSIBLE
VERY EASILY POSSIBLE HE WEARS HIS FAITH BUT AS
THE FASHION OF HIS HAT IT EVER CHANGES WITH THE
NEXT BLOCK 
I SEE LADY THE GENTLEMAN IS NOT IN YOUR BOOKS 
NO AN HE WERE I WOULD BURN MY STUDY  BUT I PRAY
YOU WHO IS HIS COMPANION IS THERE NO YOUNG
SQUARER NOW THAT WILL MAKE A VOYAGE WITH HIM TO THE DEVIL
HE IS MOST IN THE COMPANY OF THE RIGHT NOBLE CLAUDIO 
O LORD HE WILL HANG UPON HIM LIKE A DISEASE HE
IS SOONER CAUGHT THAN THE PESTILENCE AND THE TAKER
RUNS PRESENTLY MAD  GOD HELP THE NOBLE CLAUDIO  IF
HE HAVE CAUGHT THE BENEDICK IT WILL COST HIM A
THOUSAND POUND ERE A BE CURED

GOOD SIGNIOR LEONATO YOU ARE COME TO MEET YOUR

I WONDER THAT YOU WILL STILL BE TALKING SIGNIOR
BENEDICK NOBODY MARKS YOU 
WHAT MY DEAR LADY DISDAIN  ARE YOU YET LIVING

AM LOVED OF ALL LADIES ONLY YOU EXCEPTED AND I
WOULD I COULD FIND IN MY HEART THAT I HAD NOT A HARD
HEART FOR TRULY I LOVE NONE

HAD RATHER HEAR MY DOG BARK AT A CROW THAN A MAN
SWEAR HE LOVES ME 
GOD KEEP YOUR LADYSHIP STILL IN THAT MIND  SO SOME
GENTLEMAN OR OTHER SHALL SCAPE A PREDESTINATE
SCRATCHED FACE 
SCRATCHING COULD NOT MAKE IT WORSE AN TWERE SUCH

HAVE LEFT THEIR PLACES VACANT IN THEIR ROOMS
COME THRONGING SOFT AND DELICATE DESIRES
ALL PROMPTING ME HOW FAIR YOUNG HERO IS
SAYING I LIKED HER ERE I WENT TO WARS

AND THOU SHALT HAVE HER  WAST NOT TO THIS END
THAT THOU BEGANST TO TWIST SO FINE A STORY
HOW SWEETLY YOU DO MINISTER TO LOVE
THAT KNOW LOVES GRIEF BY HIS COMPLEXION 
BUT LEST MY LIKING MIGHT TOO SUDDEN SEEM
I WOULD HAVE SALVED IT WITH A LONGER TREATISE 
WHAT NEED THE BRIDGE MUCH BROADER THAN THE FLOOD
THE FAIREST GRANT IS THE NECESSITY 
LOOK WHAT WILL SERVE IS FIT TIS ONCE THOU LOVEST
AND I WILL FIT THEE WITH THE REMEDY 
I KNOW WE SHALL HAVE REVELLING TONIGHT
I WILL ASSUME THY PART IN SOME DISGUISE
AND TELL FAIR HERO I AM CLAUDIO

AND TAKE HER HEARING PRISONER WITH THE FORCE
AND STRONG ENCOUNTER OF MY AMOROUS TALE
THEN AFTER TO HER FATHER WILL I BREAK
AND THE CONCLUSION IS SHE SHALL BE THINE 
IN PRACTISE LET US PUT IT PRESENTLY 
HOW NOW BROTHER  WHERE IS MY COUSIN YOUR SON
HATH HE PROVIDED THIS MUSIC
HE IS VERY BUSY ABOUT IT  BUT BROTHER I CAN TELL
YOU STRANGE NEWS THAT YOU YET DREAMT NOT OF 
ARE THEY GOOD
AS THE EVENT STAMPS THEM BUT THEY HAVE A GOOD
COVER THEY SHOW WELL OUTWARD  THE PRINCE AND COUNT
CLAUDIO WALKING IN A THICKPLEACHED ALLEY IN MINE
ORCHARD WERE THUS MUCH OVERHEARD BY A MAN OF MINE
THE PRINCE DISCOVERED TO CLAUDIO THAT HE LOVED MY
NIECE YOUR DAUGHTER AND MEANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
THIS NIGHT IN A DANCE AND IF HE FOUND HER
ACCORDANT HE MEANT TO TAKE THE PRESENT TIME BY THE
TOP AND INSTANTLY BREAK WITH YOU OF IT 
HATH THE FELLOW ANY WIT THAT TOLD YOU THIS
A GOOD SHARP FELLOW I WILL SEND FOR HIM AND
QUESTION HIM YOURSELF 
NO NO WE WILL HOLD IT AS A DREAM TILL IT APPEAR
ITSELF BUT I WILL ACQUAINT MY DAUGHTER WITHAL
THAT SHE MAY BE THE BETTER PREPARED FOR AN ANSWER
IF PERADVENTURE THIS BE TRUE  GO YOU AND TELL HER OF IT

MERCY FRIEND GO YOU WITH ME AND I WILL USE YOUR
SKILL  GOOD COUSIN HAVE A CARE THIS BUSY TIME

THEREFORE THE SADNESS IS WITHOUT LIMIT 
YOU SHOULD HEAR REASON 
AND WHEN I HAVE HEARD IT WHAT BLESSING BRINGS IT
IF NOT A PRESENT REMEDY AT LEAST A PATIENT
SUFFERANCE 
I WONDER THAT THOU BEING AS THOU SAYEST THOU ART
BORN UNDER SATURN GOEST ABOUT TO APPLY A MORAL
MEDICINE TO A MORTIFYING MISCHIEF  I CANNOT HIDE
WHAT I AM I MUST BE SAD WHEN I HAVE CAUSE AND SMILE
AT NO MANS JESTS EAT WHEN I HAVE STOMACH AND WAIT
FOR NO MANS LEISURE SLEEP WHEN I AM DROWSY AND
TEND ON NO MANS BUSINESS LAUGH WHEN I AM MERRY AND
CLAW NO MAN IN HIS HUMOUR 
YEA BUT YOU MUST NOT MAKE THE FULL SHOW OF THIS
TILL YOU MAY DO IT WITHOUT CONTROLMENT  YOU HAVE OF
LATE STOOD OUT AGAINST YOUR BROTHER AND HE HATH
TAEN YOU NEWLY INTO HIS GRACE WHERE IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE YOU SHOULD TAKE TRUE ROOT BUT BY THE
FAIR WEATHER THAT YOU MAKE YOURSELF IT IS NEEDFUL
THAT YOU FRAME THE SEASON FOR YOUR OWN HARVEST 
I HAD RATHER BE A CANKER IN A HEDGE THAN A ROSE IN
HIS GRACE AND IT BETTER FITS MY BLOOD TO BE
DISDAINED OF ALL THAN TO FASHION A CARRIAGE TO ROB
LOVE FROM ANY IN THIS THOUGH I CANNOT BE SAID TO
BE A FLATTERING HONEST MAN IT MUST NOT BE DENIED
BUT I AM A PLAINDEALING VILLAIN  I AM TRUSTED WITH
A MUZZLE AND ENFRANCHISED WITH A CLOG THEREFORE I
HAVE DECREED NOT TO SING IN MY CAGE  IF I HAD MY
MOUTH I WOULD BITE IF I HAD MY LIBERTY I WOULD DO
MY LIKING IN THE MEANTIME LET ME BE THAT I AM AND
SEEK NOT TO ALTER ME 
CAN YOU MAKE NO USE OF YOUR DISCONTENT

CARVING THE FASHION OF A NEW DOUBLET  HE WAS WONT TO
SPEAK PLAIN AND TO THE PURPOSE LIKE AN HONEST MAN
AND A SOLDIER AND NOW IS HE TURNED ORTHOGRAPHY HIS
WORDS ARE A VERY FANTASTICAL BANQUET JUST SO MANY
STRANGE DISHES  MAY I BE SO CONVERTED AND SEE WITH
THESE EYES I CANNOT TELL I THINK NOT I WILL NOT
BE SWORN BUT LOVE MAY TRANSFORM ME TO AN OYSTER BUT

TODAY THAT YOUR NIECE BEATRICE WAS IN LOVE WITH
SIGNIOR BENEDICK
O AY STALK ON  STALK ON THE FOWL SITS  I DID
NEVER THINK THAT LADY WOULD HAVE LOVED ANY MAN 
NO NOR I NEITHER BUT MOST WONDERFUL THAT SHE
SHOULD SO DOTE ON SIGNIOR BENEDICK WHOM SHE HATH IN
ALL OUTWARD BEHAVIORS SEEMED EVER TO ABHOR 
IST POSSIBLE SITS THE WIND IN THAT CORNER
BY MY TROTH MY LORD I CANNOT TELL WHAT TO THINK
OF IT BUT THAT SHE LOVES HIM WITH AN ENRAGED
AFFECTION IT IS PAST THE INFINITE OF THOUGHT 
MAY BE SHE DOTH BUT COUNTERFEIT 
FAITH LIKE ENOUGH 
O GOD COUNTERFEIT  THERE WAS NEVER COUNTERFEIT OF
PASSION CAME SO NEAR THE LIFE OF PASSION AS SHE
DISCOVERS IT 
WHY WHAT EFFECTS OF PASSION SHOWS SHE
BAIT THE HOOK WELL THIS FISH WILL BITE 
WHAT EFFECTS MY LORD SHE WILL SIT YOU YOU HEARD
MY DAUGHTER TELL YOU HOW 
SHE DID INDEED 
HOW HOW PRAY YOU YOU AMAZE ME I WOULD HAVE I
THOUGHT HER SPIRIT HAD BEEN INVINCIBLE AGAINST ALL
ASSAULTS OF AFFECTION 
I WOULD HAVE SWORN IT HAD MY LORD ESPECIALLY
AGAINST BENEDICK 
I SHOULD THINK THIS A GULL BUT THAT THE
WHITEBEARDED FELLOW SPEAKS IT KNAVERY CANNOT
SURE HIDE HIMSELF IN SUCH REVERENCE 
HE HATH TAEN THE INFECTION HOLD IT UP 
HATH SHE MADE HER AFFECTION KNOWN TO BENEDICK
NO AND SWEARS SHE NEVER WILL THATS HER TORMENT 
TIS TRUE INDEED SO YOUR DAUGHTER SAYS SHALL
I SAYS SHE THAT HAVE SO OFT ENCOUNTERED HIM
WITH SCORN WRITE TO HIM THAT I LOVE HIM
THIS SAYS SHE NOW WHEN SHE IS BEGINNING TO WRITE TO
HIM FOR SHELL BE UP TWENTY TIMES A NIGHT AND
THERE WILL SHE SIT IN HER SMOCK TILL SHE HAVE WRIT A
SHEET OF PAPER MY DAUGHTER TELLS US ALL 
NOW YOU TALK OF A SHEET OF PAPER I REMEMBER A
PRETTY JEST YOUR DAUGHTER TOLD US OF 
O WHEN SHE HAD WRIT IT AND WAS READING IT OVER SHE
FOUND BENEDICK AND BEATRICE BETWEEN THE SHEET
THAT 
O SHE TORE THE LETTER INTO A THOUSAND HALFPENCE
RAILED AT HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO IMMODEST
TO WRITE TO ONE THAT SHE KNEW WOULD FLOUT HER I
MEASURE HIM SAYS SHE BY MY OWN SPIRIT FOR I
SHOULD FLOUT HIM IF HE WRIT TO ME YEA THOUGH I
LOVE HIM I SHOULD 
THEN DOWN UPON HER KNEES SHE FALLS WEEPS SOBS
BEATS HER HEART TEARS HER HAIR PRAYS CURSES O
SWEET BENEDICK  GOD GIVE ME PATIENCE 
SHE DOTH INDEED MY DAUGHTER SAYS SO AND THE
ECSTASY HATH SO MUCH OVERBORNE HER THAT MY DAUGHTER
IS SOMETIME AFEARED SHE WILL DO A DESPERATE OUTRAGE
TO HERSELF IT IS VERY TRUE 
IT WERE GOOD THAT BENEDICK KNEW OF IT BY SOME
OTHER IF SHE WILL NOT DISCOVER IT 
TO WHAT END HE WOULD MAKE BUT A SPORT OF IT AND
TORMENT THE POOR LADY WORSE 
AN HE SHOULD IT WERE AN ALMS TO HANG HIM  SHES AN
EXCELLENT SWEET LADY AND OUT OF ALL SUSPICION
SHE IS VIRTUOUS 
AND SHE IS EXCEEDING WISE 
IN EVERY THING BUT IN LOVING BENEDICK 
O MY LORD WISDOM AND BLOOD COMBATING IN SO TENDER
A BODY WE HAVE TEN PROOFS TO ONE THAT BLOOD HATH
THE VICTORY  I AM SORRY FOR HER AS I HAVE JUST
CAUSE BEING HER UNCLE AND HER GUARDIAN 
I WOULD SHE HAD BESTOWED THIS DOTAGE ON ME I WOULD
HAVE DAFFED ALL OTHER RESPECTS AND MADE HER HALF
MYSELF  I PRAY YOU TELL BENEDICK OF IT AND HEAR
WHAT A WILL SAY 
WERE IT GOOD THINK YOU
HERO THINKS SURELY SHE WILL DIE FOR SHE SAYS SHE
WILL DIE IF HE LOVE HER NOT AND SHE WILL DIE ERE
SHE MAKE HER LOVE KNOWN AND SHE WILL DIE IF HE WOO
HER RATHER THAN SHE WILL BATE ONE BREATH OF HER
ACCUSTOMED CROSSNESS 
SHE DOTH WELL IF SHE SHOULD MAKE TENDER OF HER
LOVE TIS VERY POSSIBLE HELL SCORN IT FOR THE
MAN AS YOU KNOW ALL HATH A CONTEMPTIBLE SPIRIT 
HE IS A VERY PROPER MAN 
HE HATH INDEED A GOOD OUTWARD HAPPINESS 
BEFORE GOD  AND IN MY MIND VERY WISE 
HE DOTH INDEED SHOW SOME SPARKS THAT ARE LIKE WIT 
AND I TAKE HIM TO BE VALIANT 
AS HECTOR I ASSURE YOU AND IN THE MANAGING OF
QUARRELS YOU MAY SAY HE IS WISE FOR EITHER HE
AVOIDS THEM WITH GREAT DISCRETION OR UNDERTAKES
THEM WITH A MOST CHRISTIANLIKE FEAR 
IF HE DO FEAR GOD A MUST NECESSARILY KEEP PEACE
IF HE BREAK THE PEACE HE OUGHT TO ENTER INTO A
QUARREL WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING 
AND SO WILL HE DO FOR THE MAN DOTH FEAR GOD
HOWSOEVER IT SEEMS NOT IN HIM BY SOME LARGE JESTS
HE WILL MAKE  WELL I AM SORRY FOR YOUR NIECE  SHALL
WE GO SEEK BENEDICK AND TELL HIM OF HER LOVE
NEVER TELL HIM MY LORD LET HER WEAR IT OUT WITH
GOOD COUNSEL 
NAY THATS IMPOSSIBLE SHE MAY WEAR HER HEART OUT FIRST 
WELL WE WILL HEAR FURTHER OF IT BY YOUR DAUGHTER
LET IT COOL THE WHILE  I LOVE BENEDICK WELL AND I
COULD WISH HE WOULD MODESTLY EXAMINE HIMSELF TO SEE
HOW MUCH HE IS UNWORTHY SO GOOD A LADY 
MY LORD WILL YOU WALK DINNER IS READY 
IF HE DO NOT DOTE ON HER UPON THIS I WILL NEVER
TRUST MY EXPECTATION 
LET THERE BE THE SAME NET SPREAD FOR HER AND THAT
MUST YOUR DAUGHTER AND HER GENTLEWOMEN CARRY  THE
SPORT WILL BE WHEN THEY HOLD ONE AN OPINION OF
ANOTHERS DOTAGE AND NO SUCH MATTER THATS THE
SCENE THAT I WOULD SEE WHICH WILL BE MERELY A
DUMBSHOW  LET US SEND HER TO CALL HIM IN TO DINNER 
  THIS CAN BE NO TRICK THE
CONFERENCE WAS SADLY BORNE  THEY HAVE THE TRUTH OF
THIS FROM HERO  THEY SEEM TO PITY THE LADY IT
SEEMS HER AFFECTIONS HAVE THEIR FULL BENT  LOVE ME 
WHY IT MUST BE REQUITED  I HEAR HOW I AM CENSURED
THEY SAY I WILL BEAR MYSELF PROUDLY IF I PERCEIVE
THE LOVE COME FROM HER THEY SAY TOO THAT SHE WILL
RATHER DIE THAN GIVE ANY SIGN OF AFFECTION  I DID
NEVER THINK TO MARRY I MUST NOT SEEM PROUD HAPPY
ARE THEY THAT HEAR THEIR DETRACTIONS AND CAN PUT
THEM TO MENDING  THEY SAY THE LADY IS FAIR TIS A
TRUTH I CAN BEAR THEM WITNESS AND VIRTUOUS TIS
SO I CANNOT REPROVE IT AND WISE BUT FOR LOVING
ME BY MY TROTH IT IS NO ADDITION TO HER WIT NOR
NO GREAT ARGUMENT OF HER FOLLY FOR I WILL BE
HORRIBLY IN LOVE WITH HER  I MAY CHANCE HAVE SOME
ODD QUIRKS AND REMNANTS OF WIT BROKEN ON ME
BECAUSE I HAVE RAILED SO LONG AGAINST MARRIAGE BUT
DOTH NOT THE APPETITE ALTER A MAN LOVES THE MEAT
IN HIS YOUTH THAT HE CANNOT ENDURE IN HIS AGE 
SHALL QUIPS AND SENTENCES AND THESE PAPER BULLETS OF
THE BRAIN AWE A MAN FROM THE CAREER OF HIS HUMOUR
NO THE WORLD MUST BE PEOPLED  WHEN I SAID I WOULD
DIE A BACHELOR I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD LIVE TILL I
WERE MARRIED  HERE COMES BEATRICE  BY THIS DAY 
SHES A FAIR LADY I DO SPY SOME MARKS OF LOVE IN
HER 
AGAINST MY WILL I AM SENT TO BID YOU COME IN TO DINNER 
FAIR BEATRICE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PAINS 
I TOOK NO MORE PAINS FOR THOSE THANKS THAN YOU TAKE
PAINS TO THANK ME IF IT HAD BEEN PAINFUL I WOULD
NOT HAVE COME 
YOU TAKE PLEASURE THEN IN THE MESSAGE
YEA JUST SO MUCH AS YOU MAY TAKE UPON A KNIFES
POINT AND CHOKE A DAW WITHAL  YOU HAVE NO STOMACH
SIGNIOR FARE YOU WELL 
HA  AGAINST MY WILL I AM SENT TO BID YOU COME IN
TO DINNER THERES A DOUBLE MEANING IN THAT I TOOK
NO MORE PAINS FOR THOSE THANKS THAN YOU TOOK PAINS
TO THANK ME  THATS AS MUCH AS TO SAY ANY PAINS
THAT I TAKE FOR YOU IS AS EASY AS THANKS  IF I DO
NOT TAKE PITY OF HER I AM A VILLAIN IF I DO NOT
LOVE HER I AM A JEW  I WILL GO GET HER PICTURE 
GOOD MARGARET RUN THEE TO THE PARLOR
THERE SHALT THOU FIND MY COUSIN BEATRICE
PROPOSING WITH THE PRINCE AND CLAUDIO
WHISPER HER EAR AND TELL HER I AND URSULA
WALK IN THE ORCHARD AND OUR WHOLE DISCOURSE
IS ALL OF HER SAY THAT THOU OVERHEARDST US
AND BID HER STEAL INTO THE PLEACHED BOWER
WHERE HONEYSUCKLES RIPEND BY THE SUN
FORBID THE SUN TO ENTER LIKE FAVOURITES
MADE PROUD BY PRINCES THAT ADVANCE THEIR PRIDE
AGAINST THAT POWER THAT BRED IT THERE WILL SHE HIDE HER
TO LISTEN OUR PURPOSE   THIS IS THY OFFICE
BEAR THEE WELL IN IT AND LEAVE US ALONE 
ILL MAKE HER COME I WARRANT YOU PRESENTLY 
NOW URSULA WHEN BEATRICE DOTH COME
AS WE DO TRACE THIS ALLEY UP AND DOWN
OUR TALK MUST ONLY BE OF BENEDICK 
WHEN I DO NAME HIM LET IT BE THY PART
TO PRAISE HIM MORE THAN EVER MAN DID MERIT
MY TALK TO THEE MUST BE HOW BENEDICK
IS SICK IN LOVE WITH BEATRICE  OF THIS MATTER
IS LITTLE CUPIDS CRAFTY ARROW MADE
THAT ONLY WOUNDS BY HEARSAY 
NOW BEGIN
FOR LOOK WHERE BEATRICE LIKE A LAPWING RUNS
CLOSE BY THE GROUND TO HEAR OUR CONFERENCE 
THE PLEASANTST ANGLING IS TO SEE THE FISH
CUT WITH HER GOLDEN OARS THE SILVER STREAM
AND GREEDILY DEVOUR THE TREACHEROUS BAIT
SO ANGLE WE FOR BEATRICE WHO EVEN NOW
IS COUCHED IN THE WOODBINE COVERTURE 
FEAR YOU NOT MY PART OF THE DIALOGUE 
THEN GO WE NEAR HER THAT HER EAR LOSE NOTHING
OF THE FALSE SWEET BAIT THAT WE LAY FOR IT 
NO TRULY URSULA SHE IS TOO DISDAINFUL
I KNOW HER SPIRITS ARE AS COY AND WILD
AS HAGGERDS OF THE ROCK 
BUT ARE YOU SURE
THAT BENEDICK LOVES BEATRICE SO ENTIRELY
SO SAYS THE PRINCE AND MY NEWTROTHED LORD 
AND DID THEY BID YOU TELL HER OF IT MADAM
THEY DID ENTREAT ME TO ACQUAINT HER OF IT
BUT I PERSUADED THEM IF THEY LOVED BENEDICK
TO WISH HIM WRESTLE WITH AFFECTION
AND NEVER TO LET BEATRICE KNOW OF IT 
WHY DID YOU SO DOTH NOT THE GENTLEMAN
DESERVE AS FULL AS FORTUNATE A BED
AS EVER BEATRICE SHALL COUCH UPON
O GOD OF LOVE  I KNOW HE DOTH DESERVE
AS MUCH AS MAY BE YIELDED TO A MAN
BUT NATURE NEVER FRAMED A WOMANS HEART
OF PROUDER STUFF THAN THAT OF BEATRICE
DISDAIN AND SCORN RIDE SPARKLING IN HER EYES
MISPRISING WHAT THEY LOOK ON AND HER WIT
VALUES ITSELF SO HIGHLY THAT TO HER
ALL MATTER ELSE SEEMS WEAK SHE CANNOT LOVE
NOR TAKE NO SHAPE NOR PROJECT OF AFFECTION
SHE IS SO SELFENDEARED 
SURE I THINK SO
AND THEREFORE CERTAINLY IT WERE NOT GOOD
SHE KNEW HIS LOVE LEST SHE MAKE SPORT AT IT 
WHY YOU SPEAK TRUTH  I NEVER YET SAW MAN
HOW WISE HOW NOBLE YOUNG HOW RARELY FEATURED
BUT SHE WOULD SPELL HIM BACKWARD IF FAIRFACED
SHE WOULD SWEAR THE GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE HER SISTER
IF BLACK WHY NATURE DRAWING OF AN ANTIQUE
MADE A FOUL BLOT IF TALL A LANCE ILLHEADED
IF LOW AN AGATE VERY VILELY CUT
IF SPEAKING WHY A VANE BLOWN WITH ALL WINDS
IF SILENT WHY A BLOCK MOVED WITH NONE 
SO TURNS SHE EVERY MAN THE WRONG SIDE OUT
AND NEVER GIVES TO TRUTH AND VIRTUE THAT
WHICH SIMPLENESS AND MERIT PURCHASETH 
SURE SURE SUCH CARPING IS NOT COMMENDABLE 
NO NOT TO BE SO ODD AND FROM ALL FASHIONS
AS BEATRICE IS CANNOT BE COMMENDABLE
BUT WHO DARE TELL HER SO IF I SHOULD SPEAK
SHE WOULD MOCK ME INTO AIR O SHE WOULD LAUGH ME
OUT OF MYSELF PRESS ME TO DEATH WITH WIT 
THEREFORE LET BENEDICK LIKE COVERD FIRE
CONSUME AWAY IN SIGHS WASTE INWARDLY
IT WERE A BETTER DEATH THAN DIE WITH MOCKS
WHICH IS AS BAD AS DIE WITH TICKLING 
YET TELL HER OF IT HEAR WHAT SHE WILL SAY 
NO RATHER I WILL GO TO BENEDICK
AND COUNSEL HIM TO FIGHT AGAINST HIS PASSION 
AND TRULY ILL DEVISE SOME HONEST SLANDERS
TO STAIN MY COUSIN WITH ONE DOTH NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH AN ILL WORD MAY EMPOISON LIKING 
O DO NOT DO YOUR COUSIN SUCH A WRONG 
SHE CANNOT BE SO MUCH WITHOUT TRUE JUDGMENT 
HAVING SO SWIFT AND EXCELLENT A WIT
AS SHE IS PRIZED TO HAVE AS TO REFUSE
SO RARE A GENTLEMAN AS SIGNIOR BENEDICK 
HE IS THE ONLY MAN OF ITALY 
ALWAYS EXCEPTED MY DEAR CLAUDIO 
I PRAY YOU BE NOT ANGRY WITH ME MADAM
SPEAKING MY FANCY SIGNIOR BENEDICK
FOR SHAPE FOR BEARING ARGUMENT AND VALOUR
GOES FOREMOST IN REPORT THROUGH ITALY 
INDEED HE HATH AN EXCELLENT GOOD NAME 
HIS EXCELLENCE DID EARN IT ERE HE HAD IT 
WHEN ARE YOU MARRIED MADAM
WHY EVERY DAY TOMORROW  COME GO IN
ILL SHOW THEE SOME ATTIRES AND HAVE THY COUNSEL
WHICH IS THE BEST TO FURNISH ME TOMORROW 
SHES LIMED I WARRANT YOU WE HAVE CAUGHT HER MADAM 
IF IT PROVES SO THEN LOVING GOES BY HAPS
SOME CUPID KILLS WITH ARROWS SOME WITH TRAPS 

WHAT FIRE IS IN MINE EARS CAN THIS BE TRUE
STAND I CONDEMND FOR PRIDE AND SCORN SO MUCH
CONTEMPT FAREWELL  AND MAIDEN PRIDE ADIEU 
NO GLORY LIVES BEHIND THE BACK OF SUCH 
AND BENEDICK LOVE ON I WILL REQUITE THEE
TAMING MY WILD HEART TO THY LOVING HAND
IF THOU DOST LOVE MY KINDNESS SHALL INCITE THEE
TO BIND OUR LOVES UP IN A HOLY BAND
FOR OTHERS SAY THOU DOST DESERVE AND I
BELIEVE IT BETTER THAN REPORTINGLY 
I DO BUT STAY TILL YOUR MARRIAGE BE CONSUMMATE AND
THEN GO I TOWARD ARRAGON 
ILL BRING YOU THITHER MY LORD IF YOULL
VOUCHSAFE ME 
NAY THAT WOULD BE AS GREAT A SOIL IN THE NEW GLOSS
OF YOUR MARRIAGE AS TO SHOW A CHILD HIS NEW COAT
AND FORBID HIM TO WEAR IT  I WILL ONLY BE BOLD
WITH BENEDICK FOR HIS COMPANY FOR FROM THE CROWN
OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT HE IS ALL
MIRTH HE HATH TWICE OR THRICE CUT CUPIDS
BOWSTRING AND THE LITTLE HANGMAN DARE NOT SHOOT AT
HIM HE HATH A HEART AS SOUND AS A BELL AND HIS
TONGUE IS THE CLAPPER FOR WHAT HIS HEART THINKS HIS
TONGUE SPEAKS 
GALLANTS I AM NOT AS I HAVE BEEN 
SO SAY I METHINKS YOU ARE SADDER 
I HOPE HE BE IN LOVE 
HANG HIM TRUANT  THERES NO TRUE DROP OF BLOOD IN
HIM TO BE TRULY TOUCHED WITH LOVE IF HE BE SAD
HE WANTS MONEY 
I HAVE THE TOOTHACHE 
DRAW IT 
HANG IT 
YOU MUST HANG IT FIRST AND DRAW IT AFTERWARDS 
WHAT  SIGH FOR THE TOOTHACHE
WHERE IS BUT A HUMOUR OR A WORM 
WELL EVERY ONE CAN MASTER A GRIEF BUT HE THAT HAS
IT 
YET SAY I HE IS IN LOVE 
THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF FANCY IN HIM UNLESS IT BE
A FANCY THAT HE HATH TO STRANGE DISGUISES AS TO BE
A DUTCHMAN TODAY A FRENCHMAN TOMORROW OR IN THE
SHAPE OF TWO COUNTRIES AT ONCE AS A GERMAN FROM
THE WAIST DOWNWARD ALL SLOPS AND A SPANIARD FROM
THE HIP UPWARD NO DOUBLET  UNLESS HE HAVE A FANCY
TO THIS FOOLERY AS IT APPEARS HE HATH HE IS NO
FOOL FOR FANCY AS YOU WOULD HAVE IT APPEAR HE IS 
IF HE BE NOT IN LOVE WITH SOME WOMAN THERE IS NO
BELIEVING OLD SIGNS A BRUSHES HIS HAT O
MORNINGS WHAT SHOULD THAT BODE
HATH ANY MAN SEEN HIM AT THE BARBERS
NO BUT THE BARBERS MAN HATH BEEN SEEN WITH HIM
AND THE OLD ORNAMENT OF HIS CHEEK HATH ALREADY
STUFFED TENNISBALLS 
INDEED HE LOOKS YOUNGER THAN HE DID BY THE LOSS OF A BEARD 
NAY A RUBS HIMSELF WITH CIVET CAN YOU SMELL HIM
OUT BY THAT
THATS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THE SWEET YOUTHS IN LOVE 
THE GREATEST NOTE OF IT IS HIS MELANCHOLY 
AND WHEN WAS HE WONT TO WASH HIS FACE
YEA OR TO PAINT HIMSELF FOR THE WHICH I HEAR
WHAT THEY SAY OF HIM 
NAY BUT HIS JESTING SPIRIT WHICH IS NOW CREPT INTO
A LUTESTRING AND NOW GOVERNED BY STOPS 
INDEED THAT TELLS A HEAVY TALE FOR HIM CONCLUDE
CONCLUDE HE IS IN LOVE 
NAY BUT I KNOW WHO LOVES HIM 
THAT WOULD I KNOW TOO I WARRANT ONE THAT KNOWS HIM NOT 
YES AND HIS ILL CONDITIONS AND IN DESPITE OF
ALL DIES FOR HIM 
SHE SHALL BE BURIED WITH HER FACE UPWARDS 
YET IS THIS NO CHARM FOR THE TOOTHACHE  OLD
SIGNIOR WALK ASIDE WITH ME I HAVE STUDIED EIGHT
OR NINE WISE WORDS TO SPEAK TO YOU WHICH THESE
HOBBYHORSES MUST NOT HEAR 
FOR MY LIFE TO BREAK WITH HIM ABOUT BEATRICE 
TIS EVEN SO  HERO AND MARGARET HAVE BY THIS

BEARS WILL NOT BITE ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY MEET 
MY LORD AND BROTHER GOD SAVE YOU

WITNESSES BEAR IT COLDLY BUT TILL MIDNIGHT AND
LET THE ISSUE SHOW ITSELF

YOU HAVE SEEN THE SEQUEL 
ARE YOU GOOD MEN AND TRUE
YEA OR ELSE IT WERE PITY BUT THEY SHOULD SUFFER
SALVATION BODY AND SOUL 
NAY THAT WERE A PUNISHMENT TOO GOOD FOR THEM IF
THEY SHOULD HAVE ANY ALLEGIANCE IN THEM BEING
CHOSEN FOR THE PRINCES WATCH 
WELL GIVE THEM THEIR CHARGE NEIGHBOUR DOGBERRY 
FIRST WHO THINK YOU THE MOST DESERTLESS MAN TO BE
CONSTABLE
HUGH OTECAKE SIR OR GEORGE SEACOLE FOR THEY CAN
WRITE AND READ 
COME HITHER NEIGHBOUR SEACOLE  GOD HATH BLESSED
YOU WITH A GOOD NAME TO BE A WELLFAVOURED MAN IS
THE GIFT OF FORTUNE BUT TO WRITE AND READ COMES BY NATURE 
BOTH WHICH MASTER CONSTABLE 
YOU HAVE I KNEW IT WOULD BE YOUR ANSWER  WELL
FOR YOUR FAVOUR SIR WHY GIVE GOD THANKS AND MAKE
NO BOAST OF IT AND FOR YOUR WRITING AND READING
LET THAT APPEAR WHEN THERE IS NO NEED OF SUCH
VANITY  YOU ARE THOUGHT HERE TO BE THE MOST
SENSELESS AND FIT MAN FOR THE CONSTABLE OF THE
WATCH THEREFORE BEAR YOU THE LANTERN  THIS IS YOUR
CHARGE YOU SHALL COMPREHEND ALL VAGROM MEN YOU ARE
TO BID ANY MAN STAND IN THE PRINCES NAME 
HOW IF A WILL NOT STAND
WHY THEN TAKE NO NOTE OF HIM BUT LET HIM GO AND
PRESENTLY CALL THE REST OF THE WATCH TOGETHER AND
THANK GOD YOU ARE RID OF A KNAVE 
IF HE WILL NOT STAND WHEN HE IS BIDDEN HE IS NONE
OF THE PRINCES SUBJECTS 
TRUE AND THEY ARE TO MEDDLE WITH NONE BUT THE
PRINCES SUBJECTS  YOU SHALL ALSO MAKE NO NOISE IN
THE STREETS FOR FOR THE WATCH TO BABBLE AND TO
TALK IS MOST TOLERABLE AND NOT TO BE ENDURED 
WE WILL RATHER SLEEP THAN TALK WE KNOW WHAT
BELONGS TO A WATCH 
WHY YOU SPEAK LIKE AN ANCIENT AND MOST QUIET
WATCHMAN FOR I CANNOT SEE HOW SLEEPING SHOULD
OFFEND ONLY HAVE A CARE THAT YOUR BILLS BE NOT
STOLEN  WELL YOU ARE TO CALL AT ALL THE
ALEHOUSES AND BID THOSE THAT ARE DRUNK GET THEM TO BED 
HOW IF THEY WILL NOT
WHY THEN LET THEM ALONE TILL THEY ARE SOBER IF
THEY MAKE YOU NOT THEN THE BETTER ANSWER YOU MAY
SAY THEY ARE NOT THE MEN YOU TOOK THEM FOR 
WELL SIR 
IF YOU MEET A THIEF YOU MAY SUSPECT HIM BY VIRTUE
OF YOUR OFFICE TO BE NO TRUE MAN AND FOR SUCH
KIND OF MEN THE LESS YOU MEDDLE OR MAKE WITH THEM
WHY THE MORE IS FOR YOUR HONESTY 
IF WE KNOW HIM TO BE A THIEF SHALL WE NOT LAY
HANDS ON HIM
TRULY BY YOUR OFFICE YOU MAY BUT I THINK THEY
THAT TOUCH PITCH WILL BE DEFILED THE MOST PEACEABLE
WAY FOR YOU IF YOU DO TAKE A THIEF IS TO LET HIM
SHOW HIMSELF WHAT HE IS AND STEAL OUT OF YOUR COMPANY 
YOU HAVE BEEN ALWAYS CALLED A MERCIFUL MAN PARTNER 
TRULY I WOULD NOT HANG A DOG BY MY WILL MUCH MORE
A MAN WHO HATH ANY HONESTY IN HIM 
IF YOU HEAR A CHILD CRY IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST CALL
TO THE NURSE AND BID HER STILL IT 
HOW IF THE NURSE BE ASLEEP AND WILL NOT HEAR US
WHY THEN DEPART IN PEACE AND LET THE CHILD WAKE
HER WITH CRYING FOR THE EWE THAT WILL NOT HEAR HER
LAMB WHEN IT BAES WILL NEVER ANSWER A CALF WHEN HE BLEATS 
TIS VERY TRUE 
THIS IS THE END OF THE CHARGE YOU CONSTABLE ARE
TO PRESENT THE PRINCES OWN PERSON IF YOU MEET THE
PRINCE IN THE NIGHT YOU MAY STAY HIM 
NAY BYR OUR LADY THAT I THINK A CANNOT 
FIVE SHILLINGS TO ONE ONT WITH ANY MAN THAT KNOWS
THE STATUTES HE MAY STAY HIM MARRY NOT WITHOUT

CHID I FOR THAT AT FRUGAL NATURES FRAME
O ONE TOO MUCH BY THEE  WHY HAD I ONE
WHY EVER WAST THOU LOVELY IN MY EYES
WHY HAD I NOT WITH CHARITABLE HAND

WHO SMIRCHD THUS AND MIRED WITH INFAMY
I MIGHT HAVE SAID NO PART OF IT IS MINE
THIS SHAME DERIVES ITSELF FROM UNKNOWN LOINS
BUT MINE AND MINE I LOVED AND MINE I PRAISED
AND MINE THAT I WAS PROUD ON MINE SO MUCH
THAT I MYSELF WAS TO MYSELF NOT MINE
VALUING OF HER WHY SHE O SHE IS FALLEN
INTO A PIT OF INK THAT THE WIDE SEA
HATH DROPS TOO FEW TO WASH HER CLEAN AGAIN
AND SALT TOO LITTLE WHICH MAY SEASON GIVE
TO HER FOULTAINTED FLESH 
SIR SIR BE PATIENT 
FOR MY PART I AM SO ATTIRED IN WONDER
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY 
O ON MY SOUL MY COUSIN IS BELIED 
LADY WERE YOU HER BEDFELLOW LAST NIGHT
NO TRULY NOT ALTHOUGH UNTIL LAST NIGHT
I HAVE THIS TWELVEMONTH BEEN HER BEDFELLOW 
CONFIRMD CONFIRMD  O THAT IS STRONGER MADE
WHICH WAS BEFORE BARRD UP WITH RIBS OF IRON 
WOULD THE TWO PRINCES LIE AND CLAUDIO LIE
WHO LOVED HER SO THAT SPEAKING OF HER FOULNESS
WASHD IT WITH TEARS HENCE FROM HER  LET HER DIE 
HEAR ME A LITTLE FOR I HAVE ONLY BEEN
SILENT SO LONG AND GIVEN WAY UNTO
THIS COURSE OF FORTUNE
BY NOTING OF THE LADY  I HAVE MARKD
A THOUSAND BLUSHING APPARITIONS
TO START INTO HER FACE A THOUSAND INNOCENT SHAMES
IN ANGEL WHITENESS BEAT AWAY THOSE BLUSHES
AND IN HER EYE THERE HATH APPEARD A FIRE
TO BURN THE ERRORS THAT THESE PRINCES HOLD
AGAINST HER MAIDEN TRUTH  CALL ME A FOOL
TRUST NOT MY READING NOR MY OBSERVATIONS
WHICH WITH EXPERIMENTAL SEAL DOTH WARRANT
THE TENOR OF MY BOOK TRUST NOT MY AGE
MY REVERENCE CALLING NOR DIVINITY
IF THIS SWEET LADY LIE NOT GUILTLESS HERE
UNDER SOME BITING ERROR 
FRIAR IT CANNOT BE 
THOU SEEST THAT ALL THE GRACE THAT SHE HATH LEFT
IS THAT SHE WILL NOT ADD TO HER DAMNATION
A SIN OF PERJURY SHE NOT DENIES IT
WHY SEEKST THOU THEN TO COVER WITH EXCUSE
THAT WHICH APPEARS IN PROPER NAKEDNESS
LADY WHAT MAN IS HE YOU ARE ACCUSED OF
THEY KNOW THAT DO ACCUSE ME I KNOW NONE
IF I KNOW MORE OF ANY MAN ALIVE
THAN THAT WHICH MAIDEN MODESTY DOTH WARRANT
LET ALL MY SINS LACK MERCY  O MY FATHER
PROVE YOU THAT ANY MAN WITH ME CONVERSED
AT HOURS UNMEET OR THAT I YESTERNIGHT
MAINTAIND THE CHANGE OF WORDS WITH ANY CREATURE
REFUSE ME HATE ME TORTURE ME TO DEATH 
THERE IS SOME STRANGE MISPRISION IN THE PRINCES 
TWO OF THEM HAVE THE VERY BENT OF HONOUR
AND IF THEIR WISDOMS BE MISLED IN THIS
THE PRACTISE OF IT LIVES IN JOHN THE BASTARD
WHOSE SPIRITS TOIL IN FRAME OF VILLANIES 
I KNOW NOT  IF THEY SPEAK BUT TRUTH OF HER
THESE HANDS SHALL TEAR HER IF THEY WRONG HER HONOUR
THE PROUDEST OF THEM SHALL WELL HEAR OF IT 
TIME HATH NOT YET SO DRIED THIS BLOOD OF MINE
NOR AGE SO EAT UP MY INVENTION
NOR FORTUNE MADE SUCH HAVOC OF MY MEANS
NOR MY BAD LIFE REFT ME SO MUCH OF FRIENDS
BUT THEY SHALL FIND AWAKED IN SUCH A KIND
BOTH STRENGTH OF LIMB AND POLICY OF MIND
ABILITY IN MEANS AND CHOICE OF FRIENDS
TO QUIT ME OF THEM THROUGHLY 
PAUSE AWHILE
AND LET MY COUNSEL SWAY YOU IN THIS CASE 
YOUR DAUGHTER HERE THE PRINCES LEFT FOR DEAD
LET HER AWHILE BE SECRETLY KEPT IN
AND PUBLISH IT THAT SHE IS DEAD INDEED
MAINTAIN A MOURNING OSTENTATION
AND ON YOUR FAMILYS OLD MONUMENT
HANG MOURNFUL EPITAPHS AND DO ALL RITES
THAT APPERTAIN UNTO A BURIAL 
WHAT SHALL BECOME OF THIS WHAT WILL THIS DO
MARRY THIS WELL CARRIED SHALL ON HER BEHALF
CHANGE SLANDER TO REMORSE THAT IS SOME GOOD
BUT NOT FOR THAT DREAM I ON THIS STRANGE COURSE
BUT ON THIS TRAVAIL LOOK FOR GREATER BIRTH 
SHE DYING AS IT MUST SO BE MAINTAIND
UPON THE INSTANT THAT SHE WAS ACCUSED
SHALL BE LAMENTED PITIED AND EXCUSED
OF EVERY HEARER FOR IT SO FALLS OUT
THAT WHAT WE HAVE WE PRIZE NOT TO THE WORTH
WHILES WE ENJOY IT BUT BEING LACKD AND LOST
WHY THEN WE RACK THE VALUE THEN WE FIND
THE VIRTUE THAT POSSESSION WOULD NOT SHOW US
WHILES IT WAS OURS  SO WILL IT FARE WITH CLAUDIO
WHEN HE SHALL HEAR SHE DIED UPON HIS WORDS
THE IDEA OF HER LIFE SHALL SWEETLY CREEP
INTO HIS STUDY OF IMAGINATION
AND EVERY LOVELY ORGAN OF HER LIFE
SHALL COME APPARELLD IN MORE PRECIOUS HABIT
MORE MOVINGDELICATE AND FULL OF LIFE
INTO THE EYE AND PROSPECT OF HIS SOUL
THAN WHEN SHE LIVED INDEED THEN SHALL HE MOURN
IF EVER LOVE HAD INTEREST IN HIS LIVER
AND WISH HE HAD NOT SO ACCUSED HER
NO THOUGH HE THOUGHT HIS ACCUSATION TRUE 
LET THIS BE SO AND DOUBT NOT BUT SUCCESS
WILL FASHION THE EVENT IN BETTER SHAPE
THAN I CAN LAY IT DOWN IN LIKELIHOOD 
BUT IF ALL AIM BUT THIS BE LEVELLD FALSE
THE SUPPOSITION OF THE LADYS DEATH
WILL QUENCH THE WONDER OF HER INFAMY
AND IF IT SORT NOT WELL YOU MAY CONCEAL HER
AS BEST BEFITS HER WOUNDED REPUTATION
IN SOME RECLUSIVE AND RELIGIOUS LIFE
OUT OF ALL EYES TONGUES MINDS AND INJURIES 
SIGNIOR LEONATO LET THE FRIAR ADVISE YOU
AND THOUGH YOU KNOW MY INWARDNESS AND LOVE
IS VERY MUCH UNTO THE PRINCE AND CLAUDIO
YET BY MINE HONOUR I WILL DEAL IN THIS
AS SECRETLY AND JUSTLY AS YOUR SOUL
SHOULD WITH YOUR BODY 
BEING THAT I FLOW IN GRIEF
THE SMALLEST TWINE MAY LEAD ME 
TIS WELL CONSENTED PRESENTLY AWAY

LIFE TO MAKE THEE A DOUBLEDEALER WHICH OUT OF
QUESTION THOU WILT BE IF MY COUSIN DO NOT LOOK
EXCEEDINGLY NARROWLY TO THEE 
COME COME WE ARE FRIENDS LETS HAVE A DANCE ERE
WE ARE MARRIED THAT WE MAY LIGHTEN OUR OWN HEARTS
AND OUR WIVES HEELS

FIRST OF MY WORD THEREFORE PLAY MUSIC  PRINCE

THERE IS NO STAFF MORE REVEREND THAN ONE TIPPED WITH HORN 
MY LORD YOUR BROTHER JOHN IS TAEN IN FLIGHT
AND BROUGHT WITH ARMED MEN BACK TO MESSINA 
THINK NOT ON HIM TILL TOMORROW
ILL DEVISE THEE BRAVE PUNISHMENTS FOR HIM 
STRIKE UP PIPERS
