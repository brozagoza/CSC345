MORE WOMANLY THAN HE HARDLY GAVE AUDIENCE OR
VOUCHSAFED TO THINK HE HAD PARTNERS YOU SHALL FIND THERE
A MAN WHO IS THE ABSTRACT OF ALL FAULTS

I MUST NOT THINK THERE ARE
EVILS ENOW TO DARKEN ALL HIS GOODNESS

RATHER THAN PURCHASED WHAT HE CANNOT CHANGE
THAN WHAT HE CHOOSES 
YOU ARE TOO INDULGENT  LET US GRANT IT IS NOT
AMISS TO TUMBLE ON THE BED OF PTOLEMY
TO GIVE A KINGDOM FOR A MIRTH TO SIT
AND KEEP THE TURN OF TIPPLING WITH A SLAVE
TO REEL THE STREETS AT NOON AND STAND THE BUFFET
WITH KNAVES THAT SMELL OF SWEAT SAY THIS
BECOMES HIM 
AS HIS COMPOSURE MUST BE RARE INDEED
WHOM THESE THINGS CANNOT BLEMISH YET MUST ANTONY
NO WAY EXCUSE HIS SOILS WHEN WE DO BEAR
SO GREAT WEIGHT IN HIS LIGHTNESS  IF HE FILLD
HIS VACANCY WITH HIS VOLUPTUOUSNESS
FULL SURFEITS AND THE DRYNESS OF HIS BONES
CALL ON HIM FORT BUT TO CONFOUND SUCH TIME
THAT DRUMS HIM FROM HIS SPORT AND SPEAKS AS LOUD
AS HIS OWN STATE AND OURS TIS TO BE CHID
AS WE RATE BOYS WHO BEING MATURE IN KNOWLEDGE
PAWN THEIR EXPERIENCE TO THEIR PRESENT PLEASURE

HERES MORE NEWS

THE STALE OF HORSES AND THE GILDED PUDDLE
WHICH BEASTS WOULD COUGH AT THY PALATE THEN DID DEIGN
THE ROUGHEST BERRY ON THE RUDEST HEDGE
YEA LIKE THE STAG WHEN SNOW THE PASTURE SHEETS
THE BARKS OF TREES THOU BROWSEDST ON THE ALPS
IT IS REPORTED THOU DIDST EAT STRANGE FLESH
WHICH SOME DID DIE TO LOOK ON AND ALL THIS 
IT WOUNDS THINE HONOUR THAT I SPEAK IT NOW 
WAS BORNE SO LIKE A SOLDIER THAT THY CHEEK

NOT MOVED BY ANTONY 
I KNOW NOT MENAS
HOW LESSER ENMITIES MAY GIVE WAY TO GREATER 
WERET NOT THAT WE STAND UP AGAINST THEM ALL
TWERE PREGNANT THEY SHOULD SQUARE BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
FOR THEY HAVE ENTERTAINED CAUSE ENOUGH
TO DRAW THEIR SWORDS BUT HOW THE FEAR OF US

THE PETTY DIFFERENCE WE YET NOT KNOW 
BET AS OUR GODS WILL HAVET  IT ONLY STANDS
OUR LIVES UPON TO USE OUR STRONGEST HANDS 
COME MENAS

THE HONOUR IS SACRED WHICH HE TALKS ON NOW
SUPPOSING THAT I LACKD IT  BUT ON CAESAR
THE ARTICLE OF MY OATH 
TO LEND ME ARMS AND AID WHEN I REQUIRED THEM
THE WHICH YOU BOTH DENIED 
NEGLECTED RATHER
AND THEN WHEN POISOND HOURS HAD BOUND ME UP
FROM MINE OWN KNOWLEDGE  AS NEARLY AS I MAY
ILL PLAY THE PENITENT TO YOU BUT MINE HONESTY

WORK WITHOUT IT  TRUTH IS THAT FULVIA
TO HAVE ME OUT OF EGYPT MADE WARS HERE
FOR WHICH MYSELF THE IGNORANT MOTIVE DO
SO FAR ASK PARDON AS BEFITS MINE HONOUR

TIS NOBLE SPOKEN 
IF IT MIGHT PLEASE YOU TO ENFORCE NO FURTHER
THE GRIEFS BETWEEN YE TO FORGET THEM QUITE
WERE TO REMEMBER THAT THE PRESENT NEED

WORTHILY SPOKEN MECAENAS 
OR IF YOU BORROW ONE ANOTHERS LOVE FOR THE
INSTANT YOU MAY WHEN YOU HEAR NO MORE WORDS OF

NO WORSE A HUSBAND THAN THE BEST OF MEN
WHOSE VIRTUE AND WHOSE GENERAL GRACES SPEAK

AND ALL GREAT FEARS WHICH NOW IMPORT THEIR DANGERS
WOULD THEN BE NOTHING TRUTHS WOULD BE TALES
WHERE NOW HALF TALES BE TRUTHS HER LOVE TO BOTH

FOR TIS A STUDIED NOT A PRESENT THOUGHT
BY DUTY RUMINATED

HALF THE HEART OF CAESAR WORTHY MECAENAS  MY
HONOURABLE FRIEND AGRIPPA 
GOOD ENOBARBUS 
WE HAVE CAUSE TO BE GLAD THAT MATTERS ARE SO WELL
DIGESTED  YOU STAYED WELL BY T IN EGYPT 
AY SIR WE DID SLEEP DAY OUT OF COUNTENANCE AND
MADE THE NIGHT LIGHT WITH DRINKING 
EIGHT WILDBOARS ROASTED WHOLE AT A BREAKFAST AND
BUT TWELVE PERSONS THERE IS THIS TRUE
THIS WAS BUT AS A FLY BY AN EAGLE WE HAD MUCH MORE
MONSTROUS MATTER OF FEAST WHICH WORTHILY DESERVED NOTING 
SHES A MOST TRIUMPHANT LADY IF REPORT BE SQUARE TO
HER 
WHEN SHE FIRST MET MARK ANTONY SHE PURSED UP
HIS HEART UPON THE RIVER OF CYDNUS 
THERE SHE APPEARED INDEED OR MY REPORTER DEVISED
WELL FOR HER 
I WILL TELL YOU 
THE BARGE SHE SAT IN LIKE A BURNISHD THRONE
BURND ON THE WATER THE POOP WAS BEATEN GOLD
PURPLE THE SAILS AND SO PERFUMED THAT
THE WINDS WERE LOVESICK WITH THEM THE OARS WERE SILVER
WHICH TO THE TUNE OF FLUTES KEPT STROKE AND MADE
THE WATER WHICH THEY BEAT TO FOLLOW FASTER
AS AMOROUS OF THEIR STROKES  FOR HER OWN PERSON
IT BEGGARD ALL DESCRIPTION SHE DID LIE
IN HER PAVILION CLOTHOFGOLD OF TISSUE 
OERPICTURING THAT VENUS WHERE WE SEE
THE FANCY OUTWORK NATURE ON EACH SIDE HER
STOOD PRETTY DIMPLED BOYS LIKE SMILING CUPIDS
WITH DIVERSCOLOURD FANS WHOSE WIND DID SEEM
TO GLOW THE DELICATE CHEEKS WHICH THEY DID COOL
AND WHAT THEY UNDID DID 
O RARE FOR ANTONY 
HER GENTLEWOMEN LIKE THE NEREIDES
SO MANY MERMAIDS TENDED HER I THE EYES
AND MADE THEIR BENDS ADORNINGS AT THE HELM
A SEEMING MERMAID STEERS THE SILKEN TACKLE
SWELL WITH THE TOUCHES OF THOSE FLOWERSOFT HANDS
THAT YARELY FRAME THE OFFICE  FROM THE BARGE
A STRANGE INVISIBLE PERFUME HITS THE SENSE
OF THE ADJACENT WHARFS  THE CITY CAST
HER PEOPLE OUT UPON HER AND ANTONY
ENTHRONED I THE MARKETPLACE DID SIT ALONE
WHISTLING TO THE AIR WHICH BUT FOR VACANCY
HAD GONE TO GAZE ON CLEOPATRA TOO
AND MADE A GAP IN NATURE 
RARE EGYPTIAN 
UPON HER LANDING ANTONY SENT TO HER
INVITED HER TO SUPPER SHE REPLIED
IT SHOULD BE BETTER HE BECAME HER GUEST
WHICH SHE ENTREATED OUR COURTEOUS ANTONY
WHOM NEER THE WORD OF NO WOMAN HEARD SPEAK
BEING BARBERD TEN TIMES OER GOES TO THE FEAST
AND FOR HIS ORDINARY PAYS HIS HEART
FOR WHAT HIS EYES EAT ONLY 
ROYAL WENCH 
SHE MADE GREAT CAESAR LAY HIS SWORD TO BED
HE PLOUGHD HER AND SHE CROPPD 
I SAW HER ONCE
HOP FORTY PACES THROUGH THE PUBLIC STREET
AND HAVING LOST HER BREATH SHE SPOKE AND PANTED
THAT SHE DID MAKE DEFECT PERFECTION
AND BREATHLESS POWER BREATHE FORTH 
NOW ANTONY MUST LEAVE HER UTTERLY 
NEVER HE WILL NOT
AGE CANNOT WITHER HER NOR CUSTOM STALE
HER INFINITE VARIETY OTHER WOMEN CLOY
THE APPETITES THEY FEED BUT SHE MAKES HUNGRY
WHERE MOST SHE SATISFIES FOR VILEST THINGS
BECOME THEMSELVES IN HER THAT THE HOLY PRIESTS
BLESS HER WHEN SHE IS RIGGISH 
IF BEAUTY WISDOM MODESTY CAN SETTLE
THE HEART OF ANTONY OCTAVIA IS
A BLESSED LOTTERY TO HIM

SEEMS TO TIE THEIR FRIENDSHIP TOGETHER WILL BE THE
VERY STRANGLER OF THEIR AMITY OCTAVIA IS OF A
HOLY COLD AND STILL CONVERSATION 
WHO WOULD NOT HAVE HIS WIFE SO
NOT HE THAT HIMSELF IS NOT SO WHICH IS MARK ANTONY 
HE WILL TO HIS EGYPTIAN DISH AGAIN THEN SHALL THE
SIGHS OF OCTAVIA BLOW THE FIRE UP IN CAESAR AND AS

AMITY SHALL PROVE THE IMMEDIATE AUTHOR OF THEIR
VARIANCE  ANTONY WILL USE HIS AFFECTION WHERE IT IS

OUR FAITH MERE FOLLY YET HE THAT CAN ENDURE
TO FOLLOW WITH ALLEGIANCE A FALLN LORD
DOES CONQUER HIM THAT DID HIS MASTER CONQUER
AND EARNS A PLACE I THE STORY 
CAESARS WILL
HEAR IT APART 
NONE BUT FRIENDS SAY BOLDLY 
SO HAPLY ARE THEY FRIENDS TO ANTONY 
HE NEEDS AS MANY SIR AS CAESAR HAS
OR NEEDS NOT US  IF CAESAR PLEASE OUR MASTER
WILL LEAP TO BE HIS FRIEND FOR US YOU KNOW
WHOSE HE IS WE ARE AND THAT IS CAESARS 
SO 
THUS THEN THOU MOST RENOWND CAESAR ENTREATS
NOT TO CONSIDER IN WHAT CASE THOU STANDST
FURTHER THAN HE IS CAESAR 
GO ON RIGHT ROYAL 
HE KNOWS THAT YOU EMBRACE NOT ANTONY
AS YOU DID LOVE BUT AS YOU FEARD HIM 
O 
THE SCARS UPON YOUR HONOUR THEREFORE HE
DOES PITY AS CONSTRAINED BLEMISHES
NOT AS DESERVED 
HE IS A GOD AND KNOWS
WHAT IS MOST RIGHT MINE HONOUR WAS NOT YIELDED

             TO BE SURE OF THAT
I WILL ASK ANTONY  SIR SIR THOU ART SO LEAKY

SHALL I SAY TO CAESAR
WHAT YOU REQUIRE OF HIM FOR HE PARTLY BEGS
TO BE DESIRED TO GIVE  IT MUCH WOULD PLEASE HIM

AND DOES THE MEANEST CHARES  IT WERE FOR ME
TO THROW MY SCEPTRE AT THE INJURIOUS GODS
TO TELL THEM THAT THIS WORLD DID EQUAL THEIRS
TILL THEY HAD STOLN OUR JEWEL  ALLS BUT NAUGHT
PATIENCE IS SCOTTISH AND IMPATIENCE DOES
BECOME A DOG THATS MAD THEN IS IT SIN
TO RUSH INTO THE SECRET HOUSE OF DEATH

THE BREAKING OF SO GREAT A THING SHOULD MAKE
A GREATER CRACK THE ROUND WORLD
SHOULD HAVE SHOOK LIONS INTO CIVIL STREETS
AND CITIZENS TO THEIR DENS THE DEATH OF ANTONY
IS NOT A SINGLE DOOM IN THE NAME LAY
A MOIETY OF THE WORLD 
HE IS DEAD CAESAR
NOT BY A PUBLIC MINISTER OF JUSTICE
NOR BY A HIRED KNIFE BUT THAT SELF HAND
WHICH WRIT HIS HONOUR IN THE ACTS IT DID
HATH WITH THE COURAGE WHICH THE HEART DID LEND IT
SPLITTED THE HEART  THIS IS HIS SWORD
I ROBBD HIS WOUND OF IT BEHOLD IT STAIND
WITH HIS MOST NOBLE BLOOD 
LOOK YOU SAD FRIENDS
THE GODS REBUKE ME BUT IT IS TIDINGS
TO WASH THE EYES OF KINGS 
AND STRANGE IT IS
THAT NATURE MUST COMPEL US TO LAMENT
OUR MOST PERSISTED DEEDS 
HIS TAINTS AND HONOURS
WAGED EQUAL WITH HIM 
A RARER SPIRIT NEVER
DID STEER HUMANITY BUT YOU GODS WILL GIVE US
SOME FAULTS TO MAKE US MEN  CAESAR IS TOUCHD 
WHEN SUCH A SPACIOUS MIRRORS SET BEFORE HIM
HE NEEDS MUST SEE HIMSELF 
O ANTONY 
I HAVE FOLLOWD THEE TO THIS BUT WE DO LANCE
DISEASES IN OUR BODIES I MUST PERFORCE
HAVE SHOWN TO THEE SUCH A DECLINING DAY
OR LOOK ON THINE WE COULD NOT STALL TOGETHER
IN THE WHOLE WORLD BUT YET LET ME LAMENT
WITH TEARS AS SOVEREIGN AS THE BLOOD OF HEARTS
THAT THOU MY BROTHER MY COMPETITOR
IN TOP OF ALL DESIGN MY MATE IN EMPIRE
FRIEND AND COMPANION IN THE FRONT OF WAR
THE ARM OF MINE OWN BODY AND THE HEART
WHERE MINE HIS THOUGHTS DID KINDLE THAT OUR STARS
UNRECONCILIABLE SHOULD DIVIDE
OUR EQUALNESS TO THIS  HEAR ME GOOD FRIENDS 
BUT I WILL TELL YOU AT SOME MEETER SEASON
THE BUSINESS OF THIS MAN LOOKS OUT OF HIM
WELL HEAR HIM WHAT HE SAYS  WHENCE ARE YOU
A POOR EGYPTIAN YET  THE QUEEN MY MISTRESS
CONFINED IN ALL SHE HAS HER MONUMENT
OF THY INTENTS DESIRES INSTRUCTION
THAT SHE PREPAREDLY MAY FRAME HERSELF
TO THE WAY SHES FORCED TO 
BID HER HAVE GOOD HEART
SHE SOON SHALL KNOW OF US BY SOME OF OURS
HOW HONOURABLE AND HOW KINDLY WE
DETERMINE FOR HER FOR CAESAR CANNOT LIVE
TO BE UNGENTLE 
SO THE GODS PRESERVE THEE 
COME HITHER PROCULEIUS  GO AND SAY
WE PURPOSE HER NO SHAME GIVE HER WHAT COMFORTS
THE QUALITY OF HER PASSION SHALL REQUIRE
LEST IN HER GREATNESS BY SOME MORTAL STROKE
SHE DO DEFEAT US FOR HER LIFE IN ROME
WOULD BE ETERNAL IN OUR TRIUMPH GO

AND HOW YOU FIND OF HER 
CAESAR I SHALL 
GALLUS GO YOU ALONG 
WHERES DOLABELLA

MY DESOLATION DOES BEGIN TO MAKE

WHICH SHACKLES ACCIDENTS AND BOLTS UP CHANGE
WHICH SLEEPS AND NEVER PALATES MORE THE DUG
THE BEGGARS NURSE AND CAESARS 
CAESAR SENDS GREETING TO THE QUEEN OF EGYPT
AND BIDS THEE STUDY ON WHAT FAIR DEMANDS
THOU MEANST TO HAVE HIM GRANT THEE 
WHATS THY NAME
MY NAME IS PROCULEIUS 
ANTONY
DID TELL ME OF YOU BADE ME TRUST YOU BUT

IF IT MIGHT PLEASE YE 
HIS FACE WAS AS THE HEAVENS AND THEREIN STUCK
A SUN AND MOON WHICH KEPT THEIR COURSE

THE LITTLE O THE EARTH 
MOST SOVEREIGN CREATURE 
HIS LEGS BESTRID THE OCEAN HIS REARD ARM
CRESTED THE WORLD HIS VOICE WAS PROPERTIED
AS ALL THE TUNED SPHERES AND THAT TO FRIENDS
BUT WHEN HE MEANT TO QUAIL AND SHAKE THE ORB
HE WAS AS RATTLING THUNDER  FOR HIS BOUNTY
THERE WAS NO WINTER INT AN AUTUMN TWAS
THAT GREW THE MORE BY REAPING HIS DELIGHTS
WERE DOLPHINLIKE THEY SHOWD HIS BACK ABOVE
THE ELEMENT THEY LIVED IN IN HIS LIVERY

AS PLATES DROPPD FROM HIS POCKET 
CLEOPATRA 
THINK YOU THERE WAS OR MIGHT BE SUCH A MAN
AS THIS I DREAMD OF

ANTONYS COURSE YOU SHALL BEREAVE YOURSELF
OF MY GOOD PURPOSES AND PUT YOUR CHILDREN
