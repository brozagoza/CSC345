MY LORD ILL TELL YOU THAT SELF BILL IS URGED
WHICH IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF THE LAST KINGS REIGN
WAS LIKE AND HAD INDEED AGAINST US PASSD
BUT THAT THE SCAMBLING AND UNQUIET TIME
DID PUSH IT OUT OF FARTHER QUESTION 
BUT HOW MY LORD SHALL WE RESIST IT NOW
IT MUST BE THOUGHT ON  IF IT PASS AGAINST US
WE LOSE THE BETTER HALF OF OUR POSSESSION
FOR ALL THE TEMPORAL LANDS WHICH MEN DEVOUT
BY TESTAMENT HAVE GIVEN TO THE CHURCH
WOULD THEY STRIP FROM US BEING VALUED THUS
AS MUCH AS WOULD MAINTAIN TO THE KINGS HONOUR
FULL FIFTEEN EARLS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED KNIGHTS
SIX THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED GOOD ESQUIRES
AND TO RELIEF OF LAZARS AND WEAK AGE
OF INDIGENT FAINT SOULS PAST CORPORAL TOIL 
A HUNDRED ALMSHOUSES RIGHT WELL SUPPLIED
AND TO THE COFFERS OF THE KING BESIDE
A THOUSAND POUNDS BY THE YEAR THUS RUNS THE BILL 
THIS WOULD DRINK DEEP 
TWOULD DRINK THE CUP AND ALL 
BUT WHAT PREVENTION
THE KING IS FULL OF GRACE AND FAIR REGARD 
AND A TRUE LOVER OF THE HOLY CHURCH 
THE COURSES OF HIS YOUTH PROMISED IT NOT 
THE BREATH NO SOONER LEFT HIS FATHERS BODY
BUT THAT HIS WILDNESS MORTIFIED IN HIM
SEEMD TO DIE TOO YEA AT THAT VERY MOMENT
CONSIDERATION LIKE AN ANGEL CAME
AND WHIPPD THE OFFENDING ADAM OUT OF HIM
LEAVING HIS BODY AS A PARADISE
TO ENVELOP AND CONTAIN CELESTIAL SPIRITS 
NEVER WAS SUCH A SUDDEN SCHOLAR MADE
NEVER CAME REFORMATION IN A FLOOD
WITH SUCH A HEADY CURRANCE SCOURING FAULTS
NOR NEVER HYDRAHEADED WILFULNESS
SO SOON DID LOSE HIS SEAT AND ALL AT ONCE
AS IN THIS KING 
WE ARE BLESSED IN THE CHANGE 
HEAR HIM BUT REASON IN DIVINITY
AND ALLADMIRING WITH AN INWARD WISH
YOU WOULD DESIRE THE KING WERE MADE A PRELATE
HEAR HIM DEBATE OF COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS
YOU WOULD SAY IT HATH BEEN ALL IN ALL HIS STUDY
LIST HIS DISCOURSE OF WAR AND YOU SHALL HEAR
A FEARFUL BATTLE RENDERD YOU IN MUSIC
TURN HIM TO ANY CAUSE OF POLICY
THE GORDIAN KNOT OF IT HE WILL UNLOOSE
FAMILIAR AS HIS GARTER THAT WHEN HE SPEAKS
THE AIR A CHARTERD LIBERTINE IS STILL
AND THE MUTE WONDER LURKETH IN MENS EARS
TO STEAL HIS SWEET AND HONEYD SENTENCES
SO THAT THE ART AND PRACTIC PART OF LIFE
MUST BE THE MISTRESS TO THIS THEORIC
WHICH IS A WONDER HOW HIS GRACE SHOULD GLEAN IT
SINCE HIS ADDICTION WAS TO COURSES VAIN
HIS COMPANIES UNLETTERD RUDE AND SHALLOW
HIS HOURS FILLD UP WITH RIOTS BANQUETS SPORTS
AND NEVER NOTED IN HIM ANY STUDY
ANY RETIREMENT ANY SEQUESTRATION
FROM OPEN HAUNTS AND POPULARITY 
THE STRAWBERRY GROWS UNDERNEATH THE NETTLE
AND WHOLESOME BERRIES THRIVE AND RIPEN BEST
NEIGHBOURD BY FRUIT OF BASER QUALITY
AND SO THE PRINCE OBSCURED HIS CONTEMPLATION
UNDER THE VEIL OF WILDNESS WHICH NO DOUBT
GREW LIKE THE SUMMER GRASS FASTEST BY NIGHT
UNSEEN YET CRESCIVE IN HIS FACULTY 
IT MUST BE SO FOR MIRACLES ARE CEASED
AND THEREFORE WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THE MEANS
HOW THINGS ARE PERFECTED 
BUT MY GOOD LORD
HOW NOW FOR MITIGATION OF THIS BILL
URGED BY THE COMMONS DOTH HIS MAJESTY
INCLINE TO IT OR NO
HE SEEMS INDIFFERENT
OR RATHER SWAYING MORE UPON OUR PART
THAN CHERISHING THE EXHIBITERS AGAINST US
FOR I HAVE MADE AN OFFER TO HIS MAJESTY
UPON OUR SPIRITUAL CONVOCATION
AND IN REGARD OF CAUSES NOW IN HAND
WHICH I HAVE OPEND TO HIS GRACE AT LARGE
AS TOUCHING FRANCE TO GIVE A GREATER SUM
THAN EVER AT ONE TIME THE CLERGY YET
DID TO HIS PREDECESSORS PART WITHAL 
HOW DID THIS OFFER SEEM RECEIVED MY LORD
WITH GOOD ACCEPTANCE OF HIS MAJESTY
SAVE THAT THERE WAS NOT TIME ENOUGH TO HEAR
AS I PERCEIVED HIS GRACE WOULD FAIN HAVE DONE
THE SEVERALS AND UNHIDDEN PASSAGES
OF HIS TRUE TITLES TO SOME CERTAIN DUKEDOMS
AND GENERALLY TO THE CROWN AND SEAT OF FRANCE
DERIVED FROM EDWARD HIS GREATGRANDFATHER 
WHAT WAS THE IMPEDIMENT THAT BROKE THIS OFF
THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR UPON THAT INSTANT
CRAVED AUDIENCE AND THE HOUR I THINK IS COME
TO GIVE HIM HEARING IS IT FOUR OCLOCK
IT IS 
THEN GO WE IN TO KNOW HIS EMBASSY
WHICH I COULD WITH A READY GUESS DECLARE
BEFORE THE FRENCHMAN SPEAK A WORD OF IT 
ILL WAIT UPON YOU AND I LONG TO HEAR IT 
WHERE IS MY GRACIOUS LORD OF CANTERBURY
NOT HERE IN PRESENCE 
SEND FOR HIM GOOD UNCLE 
SHALL WE CALL IN THE AMBASSADOR MY LIEGE
NOT YET MY COUSIN WE WOULD BE RESOLVED
BEFORE WE HEAR HIM OF SOME THINGS OF WEIGHT
THAT TASK OUR THOUGHTS CONCERNING US AND FRANCE 
GOD AND HIS ANGELS GUARD YOUR SACRED THRONE
AND MAKE YOU LONG BECOME IT 
SURE WE THANK YOU 
MY LEARNED LORD WE PRAY YOU TO PROCEED
AND JUSTLY AND RELIGIOUSLY UNFOLD
WHY THE LAW SALIQUE THAT THEY HAVE IN FRANCE
OR SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BAR US IN OUR CLAIM
AND GOD FORBID MY DEAR AND FAITHFUL LORD
THAT YOU SHOULD FASHION WREST OR BOW YOUR READING
OR NICELY CHARGE YOUR UNDERSTANDING SOUL
WITH OPENING TITLES MISCREATE WHOSE RIGHT
SUITS NOT IN NATIVE COLOURS WITH THE TRUTH
FOR GOD DOTH KNOW HOW MANY NOW IN HEALTH
SHALL DROP THEIR BLOOD IN APPROBATION
OF WHAT YOUR REVERENCE SHALL INCITE US TO 
THEREFORE TAKE HEED HOW YOU IMPAWN OUR PERSON
HOW YOU AWAKE OUR SLEEPING SWORD OF WAR
WE CHARGE YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD TAKE HEED
FOR NEVER TWO SUCH KINGDOMS DID CONTEND
WITHOUT MUCH FALL OF BLOOD WHOSE GUILTLESS DROPS
ARE EVERY ONE A WOE A SORE COMPLAINT
GAINST HIM WHOSE WRONG GIVES EDGE UNTO THE SWORDS
THAT MAKE SUCH WASTE IN BRIEF MORTALITY 
UNDER THIS CONJURATION SPEAK MY LORD
FOR WE WILL HEAR NOTE AND BELIEVE IN HEART
THAT WHAT YOU SPEAK IS IN YOUR CONSCIENCE WASHD
AS PURE AS SIN WITH BAPTISM 
THEN HEAR ME GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN AND YOU PEERS
THAT OWE YOURSELVES YOUR LIVES AND SERVICES
TO THIS IMPERIAL THRONE  THERE IS NO BAR
TO MAKE AGAINST YOUR HIGHNESS CLAIM TO FRANCE
BUT THIS WHICH THEY PRODUCE FROM PHARAMOND
IN TERRAM SALICAM MULIERES NE SUCCEDANT
NO WOMAN SHALL SUCCEED IN SALIQUE LAND
WHICH SALIQUE LAND THE FRENCH UNJUSTLY GLOZE
TO BE THE REALM OF FRANCE AND PHARAMOND
THE FOUNDER OF THIS LAW AND FEMALE BAR 
YET THEIR OWN AUTHORS FAITHFULLY AFFIRM
THAT THE LAND SALIQUE IS IN GERMANY
BETWEEN THE FLOODS OF SALA AND OF ELBE
WHERE CHARLES THE GREAT HAVING SUBDUED THE SAXONS
THERE LEFT BEHIND AND SETTLED CERTAIN FRENCH
WHO HOLDING IN DISDAIN THE GERMAN WOMEN
FOR SOME DISHONEST MANNERS OF THEIR LIFE
ESTABLISHD THEN THIS LAW TO WIT NO FEMALE
SHOULD BE INHERITRIX IN SALIQUE LAND
WHICH SALIQUE AS I SAID TWIXT ELBE AND SALA
IS AT THIS DAY IN GERMANY CALLD MEISEN 
THEN DOTH IT WELL APPEAR THAT SALIQUE LAW
WAS NOT DEVISED FOR THE REALM OF FRANCE
NOR DID THE FRENCH POSSESS THE SALIQUE LAND
UNTIL FOUR HUNDRED ONE AND TWENTY YEARS
AFTER DEFUNCTION OF KING PHARAMOND
IDLY SUPPOSED THE FOUNDER OF THIS LAW
WHO DIED WITHIN THE YEAR OF OUR REDEMPTION
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTYSIX AND CHARLES THE GREAT
SUBDUED THE SAXONS AND DID SEAT THE FRENCH
BEYOND THE RIVER SALA IN THE YEAR
EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE  BESIDES THEIR WRITERS SAY
KING PEPIN WHICH DEPOSED CHILDERIC
DID AS HEIR GENERAL BEING DESCENDED
OF BLITHILD WHICH WAS DAUGHTER TO KING CLOTHAIR
MAKE CLAIM AND TITLE TO THE CROWN OF FRANCE 
HUGH CAPET ALSO WHO USURPED THE CROWN
OF CHARLES THE DUKE OF LORRAINE SOLE HEIR MALE
OF THE TRUE LINE AND STOCK OF CHARLES THE GREAT
TO FIND HIS TITLE WITH SOME SHOWS OF TRUTH
THROUGH IN PURE TRUTH IT WAS CORRUPT AND NAUGHT
CONVEYD HIMSELF AS HEIR TO THE LADY LINGARE
DAUGHTER TO CHARLEMAIN WHO WAS THE SON
TO LEWIS THE EMPEROR AND LEWIS THE SON
OF CHARLES THE GREAT  ALSO KING LEWIS THE TENTH
WHO WAS SOLE HEIR TO THE USURPER CAPET
COULD NOT KEEP QUIET IN HIS CONSCIENCE
WEARING THE CROWN OF FRANCE TILL SATISFIED
THAT FAIR QUEEN ISABEL HIS GRANDMOTHER
WAS LINEAL OF THE LADY ERMENGARE
DAUGHTER TO CHARLES THE FORESAID DUKE OF LORRAINE
BY THE WHICH MARRIAGE THE LINE OF CHARLES THE GREAT
WAS REUNITED TO THE CROWN OF FRANCE 
SO THAT AS CLEAR AS IS THE SUMMERS SUN 
KING PEPINS TITLE AND HUGH CAPETS CLAIM
KING LEWIS HIS SATISFACTION ALL APPEAR
TO HOLD IN RIGHT AND TITLE OF THE FEMALE
SO DO THE KINGS OF FRANCE UNTO THIS DAY
HOWBEIT THEY WOULD HOLD UP THIS SALIQUE LAW
TO BAR YOUR HIGHNESS CLAIMING FROM THE FEMALE
AND RATHER CHOOSE TO HIDE THEM IN A NET
THAN AMPLY TO IMBAR THEIR CROOKED TITLES
USURPD FROM YOU AND YOUR PROGENITORS 
MAY I WITH RIGHT AND CONSCIENCE MAKE THIS CLAIM
THE SIN UPON MY HEAD DREAD SOVEREIGN 
FOR IN THE BOOK OF NUMBERS IS IT WRIT
WHEN THE MAN DIES LET THE INHERITANCE
DESCEND UNTO THE DAUGHTER  GRACIOUS LORD
STAND FOR YOUR OWN UNWIND YOUR BLOODY FLAG
LOOK BACK INTO YOUR MIGHTY ANCESTORS
GO MY DREAD LORD TO YOUR GREATGRANDSIRES TOMB
FROM WHOM YOU CLAIM INVOKE HIS WARLIKE SPIRIT
AND YOUR GREATUNCLES EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE
WHO ON THE FRENCH GROUND PLAYD A TRAGEDY
MAKING DEFEAT ON THE FULL POWER OF FRANCE
WHILES HIS MOST MIGHTY FATHER ON A HILL
STOOD SMILING TO BEHOLD HIS LIONS WHELP
FORAGE IN BLOOD OF FRENCH NOBILITY 
O NOBLE ENGLISH  THAT COULD ENTERTAIN
WITH HALF THEIR FORCES THE FULL PRIDE OF FRANCE
AND LET ANOTHER HALF STAND LAUGHING BY
ALL OUT OF WORK AND COLD FOR ACTION 
AWAKE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VALIANT DEAD
AND WITH YOUR PUISSANT ARM RENEW THEIR FEATS
YOU ARE THEIR HEIR YOU SIT UPON THEIR THRONE
THE BLOOD AND COURAGE THAT RENOWNED THEM
RUNS IN YOUR VEINS AND MY THRICEPUISSANT LIEGE
IS IN THE VERY MAYMORN OF HIS YOUTH
RIPE FOR EXPLOITS AND MIGHTY ENTERPRISES 
YOUR BROTHER KINGS AND MONARCHS OF THE EARTH
DO ALL EXPECT THAT YOU SHOULD ROUSE YOURSELF
AS DID THE FORMER LIONS OF YOUR BLOOD 
THEY KNOW YOUR GRACE HATH CAUSE AND MEANS AND MIGHT
SO HATH YOUR HIGHNESS NEVER KING OF ENGLAND
HAD NOBLES RICHER AND MORE LOYAL SUBJECTS
WHOSE HEARTS HAVE LEFT THEIR BODIES HERE IN ENGLAND
AND LIE PAVILIOND IN THE FIELDS OF FRANCE 
O LET THEIR BODIES FOLLOW MY DEAR LIEGE
WITH BLOOD AND SWORD AND FIRE TO WIN YOUR RIGHT
IN AID WHEREOF WE OF THE SPIRITUALTY
WILL RAISE YOUR HIGHNESS SUCH A MIGHTY SUM
AS NEVER DID THE CLERGY AT ONE TIME
BRING IN TO ANY OF YOUR ANCESTORS 
WE MUST NOT ONLY ARM TO INVADE THE FRENCH
BUT LAY DOWN OUR PROPORTIONS TO DEFEND
AGAINST THE SCOT WHO WILL MAKE ROAD UPON US
WITH ALL ADVANTAGES 
THEY OF THOSE MARCHES GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN
SHALL BE A WALL SUFFICIENT TO DEFEND
OUR INLAND FROM THE PILFERING BORDERERS 
WE DO NOT MEAN THE COURSING SNATCHERS ONLY
BUT FEAR THE MAIN INTENDMENT OF THE SCOT
WHO HATH BEEN STILL A GIDDY NEIGHBOUR TO US
FOR YOU SHALL READ THAT MY GREATGRANDFATHER
NEVER WENT WITH HIS FORCES INTO FRANCE
BUT THAT THE SCOT ON HIS UNFURNISHD KINGDOM
CAME POURING LIKE THE TIDE INTO A BREACH
WITH AMPLE AND BRIM FULNESS OF HIS FORCE
GALLING THE GLEANED LAND WITH HOT ASSAYS
GIRDING WITH GRIEVOUS SIEGE CASTLES AND TOWNS
THAT ENGLAND BEING EMPTY OF DEFENCE
HATH SHOOK AND TREMBLED AT THE ILL NEIGHBOURHOOD 
SHE HATH BEEN THEN MORE FEARD THAN HARMD MY LIEGE
FOR HEAR HER BUT EXAMPLED BY HERSELF
WHEN ALL HER CHIVALRY HATH BEEN IN FRANCE
AND SHE A MOURNING WIDOW OF HER NOBLES
SHE HATH HERSELF NOT ONLY WELL DEFENDED
BUT TAKEN AND IMPOUNDED AS A STRAY
THE KING OF SCOTS WHOM SHE DID SEND TO FRANCE
TO FILL KING EDWARDS FAME WITH PRISONER KINGS
AND MAKE HER CHRONICLE AS RICH WITH PRAISE
AS IS THE OOZE AND BOTTOM OF THE SEA
WITH SUNKEN WRECK AND SUNLESS TREASURIES 
BUT THERES A SAYING VERY OLD AND TRUE
IF THAT YOU WILL FRANCE WIN
THEN WITH SCOTLAND FIRST BEGIN
FOR ONCE THE EAGLE ENGLAND BEING IN PREY
TO HER UNGUARDED NEST THE WEASEL SCOT
COMES SNEAKING AND SO SUCKS HER PRINCELY EGGS
PLAYING THE MOUSE IN ABSENCE OF THE CAT
TO TEAR AND HAVOC MORE THAN SHE CAN EAT 
IT FOLLOWS THEN THE CAT MUST STAY AT HOME
YET THAT IS BUT A CRUSHD NECESSITY
SINCE WE HAVE LOCKS TO SAFEGUARD NECESSARIES
AND PRETTY TRAPS TO CATCH THE PETTY THIEVES 
WHILE THAT THE ARMED HAND DOTH FIGHT ABROAD
THE ADVISED HEAD DEFENDS ITSELF AT HOME
FOR GOVERNMENT THOUGH HIGH AND LOW AND LOWER
PUT INTO PARTS DOTH KEEP IN ONE CONSENT
CONGREEING IN A FULL AND NATURAL CLOSE
LIKE MUSIC 
THEREFORE DOTH HEAVEN DIVIDE
THE STATE OF MAN IN DIVERS FUNCTIONS
SETTING ENDEAVOUR IN CONTINUAL MOTION
TO WHICH IS FIXED AS AN AIM OR BUTT
OBEDIENCE FOR SO WORK THE HONEYBEES
CREATURES THAT BY A RULE IN NATURE TEACH
THE ACT OF ORDER TO A PEOPLED KINGDOM 
THEY HAVE A KING AND OFFICERS OF SORTS
WHERE SOME LIKE MAGISTRATES CORRECT AT HOME
OTHERS LIKE MERCHANTS VENTURE TRADE ABROAD
OTHERS LIKE SOLDIERS ARMED IN THEIR STINGS
MAKE BOOT UPON THE SUMMERS VELVET BUDS
WHICH PILLAGE THEY WITH MERRY MARCH BRING HOME
TO THE TENTROYAL OF THEIR EMPEROR
WHO BUSIED IN HIS MAJESTY SURVEYS
THE SINGING MASONS BUILDING ROOFS OF GOLD
THE CIVIL CITIZENS KNEADING UP THE HONEY
THE POOR MECHANIC PORTERS CROWDING IN
THEIR HEAVY BURDENS AT HIS NARROW GATE
THE SADEYED JUSTICE WITH HIS SURLY HUM
DELIVERING OER TO EXECUTORS PALE
THE LAZY YAWNING DRONE  I THIS INFER
THAT MANY THINGS HAVING FULL REFERENCE
TO ONE CONSENT MAY WORK CONTRARIOUSLY
AS MANY ARROWS LOOSED SEVERAL WAYS
COME TO ONE MARK AS MANY WAYS MEET IN ONE TOWN
AS MANY FRESH STREAMS MEET IN ONE SALT SEA
AS MANY LINES CLOSE IN THE DIALS CENTRE
SO MAY A THOUSAND ACTIONS ONCE AFOOT 
END IN ONE PURPOSE AND BE ALL WELL BORNE
WITHOUT DEFEAT  THEREFORE TO FRANCE MY LIEGE 
DIVIDE YOUR HAPPY ENGLAND INTO FOUR
WHEREOF TAKE YOU ONE QUARTER INTO FRANCE
AND YOU WITHAL SHALL MAKE ALL GALLIA SHAKE 
IF WE WITH THRICE SUCH POWERS LEFT AT HOME
CANNOT DEFEND OUR OWN DOORS FROM THE DOG
LET US BE WORRIED AND OUR NATION LOSE
THE NAME OF HARDINESS AND POLICY 
CALL IN THE MESSENGERS SENT FROM THE DAUPHIN 
NOW ARE WE WELL RESOLVED AND BY GODS HELP
AND YOURS THE NOBLE SINEWS OF OUR POWER
FRANCE BEING OURS WELL BEND IT TO OUR AWE
OR BREAK IT ALL TO PIECES OR THERE WELL SIT
RULING IN LARGE AND AMPLE EMPERY
OER FRANCE AND ALL HER ALMOST KINGLY DUKEDOMS
OR LAY THESE BONES IN AN UNWORTHY URN
TOMBLESS WITH NO REMEMBRANCE OVER THEM
EITHER OUR HISTORY SHALL WITH FULL MOUTH
SPEAK FREELY OF OUR ACTS OR ELSE OUR GRAVE
LIKE TURKISH MUTE SHALL HAVE A TONGUELESS MOUTH
NOT WORSHIPPD WITH A WAXEN EPITAPH 
NOW ARE WE WELL PREPARED TO KNOW THE PLEASURE
OF OUR FAIR COUSIN DAUPHIN FOR WE HEAR
YOUR GREETING IS FROM HIM NOT FROM THE KING 
MAYT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY TO GIVE US LEAVE
FREELY TO RENDER WHAT WE HAVE IN CHARGE
OR SHALL WE SPARINGLY SHOW YOU FAR OFF
THE DAUPHINS MEANING AND OUR EMBASSY
WE ARE NO TYRANT BUT A CHRISTIAN KING
UNTO WHOSE GRACE OUR PASSION IS AS SUBJECT
AS ARE OUR WRETCHES FETTERD IN OUR PRISONS
THEREFORE WITH FRANK AND WITH UNCURBED PLAINNESS
TELL US THE DAUPHINS MIND 
THUS THEN IN FEW 
YOUR HIGHNESS LATELY SENDING INTO FRANCE
DID CLAIM SOME CERTAIN DUKEDOMS IN THE RIGHT
OF YOUR GREAT PREDECESSOR KING EDWARD THE THIRD 
IN ANSWER OF WHICH CLAIM THE PRINCE OUR MASTER
SAYS THAT YOU SAVOUR TOO MUCH OF YOUR YOUTH
AND BIDS YOU BE ADVISED THERES NOUGHT IN FRANCE
THAT CAN BE WITH A NIMBLE GALLIARD WON
YOU CANNOT REVEL INTO DUKEDOMS THERE 
HE THEREFORE SENDS YOU MEETER FOR YOUR SPIRIT
THIS TUN OF TREASURE AND IN LIEU OF THIS
DESIRES YOU LET THE DUKEDOMS THAT YOU CLAIM
HEAR NO MORE OF YOU  THIS THE DAUPHIN SPEAKS 
WHAT TREASURE UNCLE
TENNISBALLS MY LIEGE 
WE ARE GLAD THE DAUPHIN IS SO PLEASANT WITH US
HIS PRESENT AND YOUR PAINS WE THANK YOU FOR
WHEN WE HAVE MARCHD OUR RACKETS TO THESE BALLS
WE WILL IN FRANCE BY GODS GRACE PLAY A SET
SHALL STRIKE HIS FATHERS CROWN INTO THE HAZARD 
TELL HIM HE HATH MADE A MATCH WITH SUCH A WRANGLER
THAT ALL THE COURTS OF FRANCE WILL BE DISTURBD
WITH CHACES  AND WE UNDERSTAND HIM WELL
HOW HE COMES OER US WITH OUR WILDER DAYS
NOT MEASURING WHAT USE WE MADE OF THEM 
WE NEVER VALUED THIS POOR SEAT OF ENGLAND
AND THEREFORE LIVING HENCE DID GIVE OURSELF
TO BARBAROUS LICENCE AS TIS EVER COMMON
THAT MEN ARE MERRIEST WHEN THEY ARE FROM HOME 
BUT TELL THE DAUPHIN I WILL KEEP MY STATE
BE LIKE A KING AND SHOW MY SAIL OF GREATNESS
WHEN I DO ROUSE ME IN MY THRONE OF FRANCE
FOR THAT I HAVE LAID BY MY MAJESTY
AND PLODDED LIKE A MAN FOR WORKINGDAYS
BUT I WILL RISE THERE WITH SO FULL A GLORY
THAT I WILL DAZZLE ALL THE EYES OF FRANCE
YEA STRIKE THE DAUPHIN BLIND TO LOOK ON US 
AND TELL THE PLEASANT PRINCE THIS MOCK OF HIS
HATH TURND HIS BALLS TO GUNSTONES AND HIS SOUL
SHALL STAND SORE CHARGED FOR THE WASTEFUL VENGEANCE
THAT SHALL FLY WITH THEM FOR MANY A THOUSAND WIDOWS
SHALL THIS HIS MOCK MOCK OUT OF THEIR DEAR HUSBANDS
MOCK MOTHERS FROM THEIR SONS MOCK CASTLES DOWN
AND SOME ARE YET UNGOTTEN AND UNBORN
THAT SHALL HAVE CAUSE TO CURSE THE DAUPHINS SCORN 
BUT THIS LIES ALL WITHIN THE WILL OF GOD
TO WHOM I DO APPEAL AND IN WHOSE NAME
TELL YOU THE DAUPHIN I AM COMING ON
TO VENGE ME AS I MAY AND TO PUT FORTH
MY RIGHTFUL HAND IN A WELLHALLOWD CAUSE 
SO GET YOU HENCE IN PEACE AND TELL THE DAUPHIN
HIS JEST WILL SAVOUR BUT OF SHALLOW WIT
WHEN THOUSANDS WEEP MORE THAN DID LAUGH AT IT 
CONVEY THEM WITH SAFE CONDUCT  FARE YOU WELL 
THIS WAS A MERRY MESSAGE 
WE HOPE TO MAKE THE SENDER BLUSH AT IT 
THEREFORE MY LORDS OMIT NO HAPPY HOUR
THAT MAY GIVE FURTHERANCE TO OUR EXPEDITION
FOR WE HAVE NOW NO THOUGHT IN US BUT FRANCE
SAVE THOSE TO GOD THAT RUN BEFORE OUR BUSINESS 
THEREFORE LET OUR PROPORTIONS FOR THESE WARS
BE SOON COLLECTED AND ALL THINGS THOUGHT UPON
THAT MAY WITH REASONABLE SWIFTNESS ADD
MORE FEATHERS TO OUR WINGS FOR GOD BEFORE
WELL CHIDE THIS DAUPHIN AT HIS FATHERS DOOR 
THEREFORE LET EVERY MAN NOW TASK HIS THOUGHT

FROM GLISTERING SEMBLANCES OF PIETY
BUT HE THAT TEMPERD THEE BADE THEE STAND UP
GAVE THEE NO INSTANCE WHY THOU SHOULDST DO TREASON
UNLESS TO DUB THEE WITH THE NAME OF TRAITOR 
IF THAT SAME DEMON THAT HATH GULLD THEE THUS
SHOULD WITH HIS LION GAIT WALK THE WHOLE WORLD
HE MIGHT RETURN TO VASTY TARTAR BACK

WHY SO DIDST THOU OR ARE THEY SPARE IN DIET
FREE FROM GROSS PASSION OR OF MIRTH OR ANGER
CONSTANT IN SPIRIT NOT SWERVING WITH THE BLOOD

OF BRABANT AND OF ORLEANS SHALL MAKE FORTH
AND YOU PRINCE DAUPHIN WITH ALL SWIFT DISPATCH
TO LINE AND NEW REPAIR OUR TOWNS OF WAR
WITH MEN OF COURAGE AND WITH MEANS DEFENDANT
FOR ENGLAND HIS APPROACHES MAKES AS FIERCE
AS WATERS TO THE SUCKING OF A GULF

AS FEAR MAY TEACH US OUT OF LATE EXAMPLES
LEFT BY THE FATAL AND NEGLECTED ENGLISH
UPON OUR FIELDS 
MY MOST REDOUBTED FATHER
IT IS MOST MEET WE ARM US GAINST THE FOE
FOR PEACE ITSELF SHOULD NOT SO DULL A KINGDOM
THOUGH WAR NOR NO KNOWN QUARREL WERE IN QUESTION
BUT THAT DEFENCES MUSTERS PREPARATIONS

THEREFORE I SAY TIS MEET WE ALL GO FORTH
TO VIEW THE SICK AND FEEBLE PARTS OF FRANCE
AND LET US DO IT WITH NO SHOW OF FEAR
NO WITH NO MORE THAN IF WE HEARD THAT ENGLAND
WERE BUSIED WITH A WHITSUN MORRISDANCE
FOR MY GOOD LIEGE SHE IS SO IDLY KINGD
HER SCEPTRE SO FANTASTICALLY BORNE
BY A VAIN GIDDY SHALLOW HUMOROUS YOUTH
THAT FEAR ATTENDS HER NOT 
O PEACE PRINCE DAUPHIN 
YOU ARE TOO MUCH MISTAKEN IN THIS KING
QUESTION YOUR GRACE THE LATE AMBASSADORS
WITH WHAT GREAT STATE HE HEARD THEIR EMBASSY
HOW WELL SUPPLIED WITH NOBLE COUNSELLORS
HOW MODEST IN EXCEPTION AND WITHAL
HOW TERRIBLE IN CONSTANT RESOLUTION
AND YOU SHALL FIND HIS VANITIES FORESPENT
WERE BUT THE OUTSIDE OF THE ROMAN BRUTUS
COVERING DISCRETION WITH A COAT OF FOLLY
AS GARDENERS DO WITH ORDURE HIDE THOSE ROOTS
THAT SHALL FIRST SPRING AND BE MOST DELICATE 
WELL TIS NOT SO MY LORD HIGH CONSTABLE
BUT THOUGH WE THINK IT SO IT IS NO MATTER
IN CASES OF DEFENCE TIS BEST TO WEIGH
THE ENEMY MORE MIGHTY THAN HE SEEMS
SO THE PROPORTIONS OF DEFENCE ARE FILLD
WHICH OF A WEAK OR NIGGARDLY PROJECTION
DOTH LIKE A MISER SPOIL HIS COAT WITH SCANTING
A LITTLE CLOTH 
THINK WE KING HARRY STRONG
AND PRINCES LOOK YOU STRONGLY ARM TO MEET HIM 
THE KINDRED OF HIM HATH BEEN FLESHD UPON US
AND HE IS BRED OUT OF THAT BLOODY STRAIN
THAT HAUNTED US IN OUR FAMILIAR PATHS
WITNESS OUR TOO MUCH MEMORABLE SHAME
WHEN CRESSY BATTLE FATALLY WAS STRUCK
AND ALL OUR PRINCES CAPTIVD BY THE HAND
OF THAT BLACK NAME EDWARD BLACK PRINCE OF WALES
WHILES THAT HIS MOUNTAIN SIRE ON MOUNTAIN STANDING
UP IN THE AIR CROWND WITH THE GOLDEN SUN
SAW HIS HEROICAL SEED AND SMILED TO SEE HIM
MANGLE THE WORK OF NATURE AND DEFACE
THE PATTERNS THAT BY GOD AND BY FRENCH FATHERS
HAD TWENTY YEARS BEEN MADE  THIS IS A STEM
OF THAT VICTORIOUS STOCK AND LET US FEAR
THE NATIVE MIGHTINESS AND FATE OF HIM 
AMBASSADORS FROM HARRY KING OF ENGLAND
DO CRAVE ADMITTANCE TO YOUR MAJESTY 
WELL GIVE THEM PRESENT AUDIENCE  GO AND BRING THEM 
YOU SEE THIS CHASE IS HOTLY FOLLOWD FRIENDS 
TURN HEAD AND STOP PURSUIT FOR COWARD DOGS
MOST SPEND THEIR MOUTHS WHEN WHAT THEY SEEM TO THREATEN
RUNS FAR BEFORE THEM  GOOD MY SOVEREIGN
TAKE UP THE ENGLISH SHORT AND LET THEM KNOW
OF WHAT A MONARCHY YOU ARE THE HEAD
SELFLOVE MY LIEGE IS NOT SO VILE A SIN
AS SELFNEGLECTING 
FROM OUR BROTHER ENGLAND
FROM HIM AND THUS HE GREETS YOUR MAJESTY 
HE WILLS YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD ALMIGHTY
THAT YOU DIVEST YOURSELF AND LAY APART
THE BORROWD GLORIES THAT BY GIFT OF HEAVEN
BY LAW OF NATURE AND OF NATIONS LONG
TO HIM AND TO HIS HEIRS NAMELY THE CROWN
AND ALL WIDESTRETCHED HONOURS THAT PERTAIN
BY CUSTOM AND THE ORDINANCE OF TIMES
UNTO THE CROWN OF FRANCE  THAT YOU MAY KNOW
TIS NO SINISTER NOR NO AWKWARD CLAIM
PICKD FROM THE WORMHOLES OF LONGVANISHD DAYS
NOR FROM THE DUST OF OLD OBLIVION RAKED
HE SENDS YOU THIS MOST MEMORABLE LINE
IN EVERY BRANCH TRULY DEMONSTRATIVE
WILLING TO OVERLOOK THIS PEDIGREE
AND WHEN YOU FIND HIM EVENLY DERIVED
FROM HIS MOST FAMED OF FAMOUS ANCESTORS
EDWARD THE THIRD HE BIDS YOU THEN RESIGN
YOUR CROWN AND KINGDOM INDIRECTLY HELD
FROM HIM THE NATIVE AND TRUE CHALLENGER 
OR ELSE WHAT FOLLOWS
BLOODY CONSTRAINT FOR IF YOU HIDE THE CROWN
EVEN IN YOUR HEARTS THERE WILL HE RAKE FOR IT
THEREFORE IN FIERCE TEMPEST IS HE COMING
IN THUNDER AND IN EARTHQUAKE LIKE A JOVE
THAT IF REQUIRING FAIL HE WILL COMPEL
AND BIDS YOU IN THE BOWELS OF THE LORD
DELIVER UP THE CROWN AND TO TAKE MERCY
ON THE POOR SOULS FOR WHOM THIS HUNGRY WAR
OPENS HIS VASTY JAWS AND ON YOUR HEAD
TURNING THE WIDOWS TEARS THE ORPHANS CRIES
THE DEAD MENS BLOOD THE PINING MAIDENS GROANS
FOR HUSBANDS FATHERS AND BETROTHED LOVERS
THAT SHALL BE SWALLOWD IN THIS CONTROVERSY 
THIS IS HIS CLAIM HIS THREATENING AND MY MESSAGE
UNLESS THE DAUPHIN BE IN PRESENCE HERE

NOTHING BUT ODDS WITH ENGLAND TO THAT END
AS MATCHING TO HIS YOUTH AND VANITY
I DID PRESENT HIM WITH THE PARIS BALLS 
HELL MAKE YOUR PARIS LOUVRE SHAKE FOR IT
WERE IT THE MISTRESSCOURT OF MIGHTY EUROPE
AND BE ASSURED YOULL FIND A DIFFERENCE
AS WE HIS SUBJECTS HAVE IN WONDER FOUND
BETWEEN THE PROMISE OF HIS GREENER DAYS

YOU SHALL BE SOON DISPATCHS WITH FAIR CONDITIONS
A NIGHT IS BUT SMALL BREATH AND LITTLE PAUSE
TO ANSWER MATTERS OF THIS CONSEQUENCE 
ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH DEAR FRIENDS ONCE MORE
OR CLOSE THE WALL UP WITH OUR ENGLISH DEAD 
IN PEACE THERES NOTHING SO BECOMES A MAN
AS MODEST STILLNESS AND HUMILITY
BUT WHEN THE BLAST OF WAR BLOWS IN OUR EARS
THEN IMITATE THE ACTION OF THE TIGER
STIFFEN THE SINEWS SUMMON UP THE BLOOD
DISGUISE FAIR NATURE WITH HARDFAVOURD RAGE
THEN LEND THE EYE A TERRIBLE ASPECT
LET PRY THROUGH THE PORTAGE OF THE HEAD
LIKE THE BRASS CANNON LET THE BROW OERWHELM IT

NOW SET THE TEETH AND STRETCH THE NOSTRIL WIDE
HOLD HARD THE BREATH AND BEND UP EVERY SPIRIT

FAR OUT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE 
IF THE ENGLISH HAD ANY APPREHENSION THEY WOULD RUN AWAY 
THAT THEY LACK FOR IF THEIR HEADS HAD ANY
INTELLECTUAL ARMOUR THEY COULD NEVER WEAR SUCH HEAVY
HEADPIECES 
THAT ISLAND OF ENGLAND BREEDS VERY VALIANT
CREATURES THEIR MASTIFFS ARE OF UNMATCHABLE COURAGE 
FOOLISH CURS THAT RUN WINKING INTO THE MOUTH OF A
RUSSIAN BEAR AND HAVE THEIR HEADS CRUSHED LIKE
ROTTEN APPLES  YOU MAY AS WELL SAY THATS A
VALIANT FLEA THAT DARE EAT HIS BREAKFAST ON THE LIP OF A LION 
JUST JUST AND THE MEN DO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE
MASTIFFS IN ROBUSTIOUS AND ROUGH COMING ON LEAVING

GREAT MEALS OF BEEF AND IRON AND STEEL THEY WILL
EAT LIKE WOLVES AND FIGHT LIKE DEVILS

CAPTAIN FLUELLEN 
SO  IN THE NAME OF JESU CHRIST SPEAK LOWER  IT IS
THE GREATEST ADMIRATION OF THE UNIVERSAL WORLD WHEN
THE TRUE AND AUNCHIENT PREROGATIFES AND LAWS OF THE
WARS IS NOT KEPT IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE PAINS BUT TO
EXAMINE THE WARS OF POMPEY THE GREAT YOU SHALL
FIND I WARRANT YOU THAT THERE IS NO TIDDLE TODDLE
NOR PIBBLE PABBLE IN POMPEYS CAMP I WARRANT YOU
YOU SHALL FIND THE CEREMONIES OF THE WARS AND THE
CARES OF IT AND THE FORMS OF IT AND THE SOBRIETY
OF IT AND THE MODESTY OF IT TO BE OTHERWISE 
WHY THE ENEMY IS LOUD YOU HEAR HIM ALL NIGHT 
IF THE ENEMY IS AN ASS AND A FOOL AND A PRATING
COXCOMB IS IT MEET THINK YOU THAT WE SHOULD ALSO
LOOK YOU BE AN ASS AND A FOOL AND A PRATING
COXCOMB IN YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE NOW
I WILL SPEAK LOWER 
I PRAY YOU AND BESEECH YOU THAT YOU WILL 
THOUGH IT APPEAR A LITTLE OUT OF FASHION
THERE IS MUCH CARE AND VALOUR IN THIS WELSHMAN 
BROTHER JOHN BATES IS NOT THAT THE MORNING WHICH
BREAKS YONDER
I THINK IT BE BUT WE HAVE NO GREAT CAUSE TO DESIRE
THE APPROACH OF DAY 
WE SEE YONDER THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY BUT I THINK
WE SHALL NEVER SEE THE END OF IT  WHO GOES THERE
A FRIEND 
UNDER WHAT CAPTAIN SERVE YOU
UNDER SIR THOMAS ERPINGHAM 
A GOOD OLD COMMANDER AND A MOST KIND GENTLEMAN I
PRAY YOU WHAT THINKS HE OF OUR ESTATE
EVEN AS MEN WRECKED UPON A SAND THAT LOOK TO BE
WASHED OFF THE NEXT TIDE 
HE HATH NOT TOLD HIS THOUGHT TO THE KING
NO NOR IT IS NOT MEET HE SHOULD  FOR THOUGH I
SPEAK IT TO YOU I THINK THE KING IS BUT A MAN AS I
AM THE VIOLET SMELLS TO HIM AS IT DOTH TO ME THE
ELEMENT SHOWS TO HIM AS IT DOTH TO ME ALL HIS
SENSES HAVE BUT HUMAN CONDITIONS HIS CEREMONIES
LAID BY IN HIS NAKEDNESS HE APPEARS BUT A MAN AND
THOUGH HIS AFFECTIONS ARE HIGHER MOUNTED THAN OURS
YET WHEN THEY STOOP THEY STOOP WITH THE LIKE
WING  THEREFORE WHEN HE SEES REASON OF FEARS AS WE
DO HIS FEARS OUT OF DOUBT BE OF THE SAME RELISH
AS OURS ARE YET IN REASON NO MAN SHOULD POSSESS
HIM WITH ANY APPEARANCE OF FEAR LEST HE BY SHOWING
IT SHOULD DISHEARTEN HIS ARMY 
HE MAY SHOW WHAT OUTWARD COURAGE HE WILL BUT I
BELIEVE AS COLD A NIGHT AS TIS HE COULD WISH
HIMSELF IN THAMES UP TO THE NECK AND SO I WOULD HE
WERE AND I BY HIM AT ALL ADVENTURES SO WE WERE QUIT HERE 
BY MY TROTH I WILL SPEAK MY CONSCIENCE OF THE KING
I THINK HE WOULD NOT WISH HIMSELF ANY WHERE BUT
WHERE HE IS 
THEN I WOULD HE WERE HERE ALONE SO SHOULD HE BE
SURE TO BE RANSOMED AND A MANY POOR MENS LIVES SAVED 
I DARE SAY YOU LOVE HIM NOT SO ILL TO WISH HIM HERE
ALONE HOWSOEVER YOU SPEAK THIS TO FEEL OTHER MENS
MINDS METHINKS I COULD NOT DIE ANY WHERE SO
CONTENTED AS IN THE KINGS COMPANY HIS CAUSE BEING
JUST AND HIS QUARREL HONOURABLE 
THATS MORE THAN WE KNOW 
AY OR MORE THAN WE SHOULD SEEK AFTER FOR WE KNOW
ENOUGH IF WE KNOW WE ARE THE KINGS SUBJECTS IF
HIS CAUSE BE WRONG OUR OBEDIENCE TO THE KING WIPES
THE CRIME OF IT OUT OF US 
BUT IF THE CAUSE BE NOT GOOD THE KING HIMSELF HATH
A HEAVY RECKONING TO MAKE WHEN ALL THOSE LEGS AND
ARMS AND HEADS CHOPPED OFF IN BATTLE SHALL JOIN
TOGETHER AT THE LATTER DAY AND CRY ALL WE DIED AT
SUCH A PLACE SOME SWEARING SOME CRYING FOR A
SURGEON SOME UPON THEIR WIVES LEFT POOR BEHIND
THEM SOME UPON THE DEBTS THEY OWE SOME UPON THEIR
CHILDREN RAWLY LEFT  I AM AFEARD THERE ARE FEW DIE
WELL THAT DIE IN A BATTLE FOR HOW CAN THEY
CHARITABLY DISPOSE OF ANY THING WHEN BLOOD IS THEIR
ARGUMENT NOW IF THESE MEN DO NOT DIE WELL IT
WILL BE A BLACK MATTER FOR THE KING THAT LED THEM TO
IT WHOM TO DISOBEY WERE AGAINST ALL PROPORTION OF
SUBJECTION 
SO IF A SON THAT IS BY HIS FATHER SENT ABOUT
MERCHANDISE DO SINFULLY MISCARRY UPON THE SEA THE
IMPUTATION OF HIS WICKEDNESS BY YOUR RULE SHOULD BE
IMPOSED UPON HIS FATHER THAT SENT HIM OR IF A
SERVANT UNDER HIS MASTERS COMMAND TRANSPORTING A
SUM OF MONEY BE ASSAILED BY ROBBERS AND DIE IN
MANY IRRECONCILED INIQUITIES YOU MAY CALL THE
BUSINESS OF THE MASTER THE AUTHOR OF THE SERVANTS
DAMNATION BUT THIS IS NOT SO THE KING IS NOT
BOUND TO ANSWER THE PARTICULAR ENDINGS OF HIS
SOLDIERS THE FATHER OF HIS SON NOR THE MASTER OF
HIS SERVANT FOR THEY PURPOSE NOT THEIR DEATH WHEN
THEY PURPOSE THEIR SERVICES  BESIDES THERE IS NO
KING BE HIS CAUSE NEVER SO SPOTLESS IF IT COME TO
THE ARBITREMENT OF SWORDS CAN TRY IT OUT WITH ALL
UNSPOTTED SOLDIERS SOME PERADVENTURE HAVE ON THEM
THE GUILT OF PREMEDITATED AND CONTRIVED MURDER
SOME OF BEGUILING VIRGINS WITH THE BROKEN SEALS OF
PERJURY SOME MAKING THE WARS THEIR BULWARK THAT
HAVE BEFORE GORED THE GENTLE BOSOM OF PEACE WITH
PILLAGE AND ROBBERY  NOW IF THESE MEN HAVE
DEFEATED THE LAW AND OUTRUN NATIVE PUNISHMENT
THOUGH THEY CAN OUTSTRIP MEN THEY HAVE NO WINGS TO
FLY FROM GOD WAR IS HIS BEADLE WAR IS VENGEANCE
SO THAT HERE MEN ARE PUNISHED FOR BEFOREBREACH OF
THE KINGS LAWS IN NOW THE KINGS QUARREL WHERE
THEY FEARED THE DEATH THEY HAVE BORNE LIFE AWAY
AND WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE THEY PERISH THEN IF
THEY DIE UNPROVIDED NO MORE IS THE KING GUILTY OF
THEIR DAMNATION THAN HE WAS BEFORE GUILTY OF THOSE
IMPIETIES FOR THE WHICH THEY ARE NOW VISITED  EVERY
SUBJECTS DUTY IS THE KINGS BUT EVERY SUBJECTS
SOUL IS HIS OWN  THEREFORE SHOULD EVERY SOLDIER IN
THE WARS DO AS EVERY SICK MAN IN HIS BED WASH EVERY
MOTE OUT OF HIS CONSCIENCE AND DYING SO DEATH
IS TO HIM ADVANTAGE OR NOT DYING THE TIME WAS
BLESSEDLY LOST WHEREIN SUCH PREPARATION WAS GAINED
AND IN HIM THAT ESCAPES IT WERE NOT SIN TO THINK
THAT MAKING GOD SO FREE AN OFFER HE LET HIM
OUTLIVE THAT DAY TO SEE HIS GREATNESS AND TO TEACH
OTHERS HOW THEY SHOULD PREPARE 
TIS CERTAIN EVERY MAN THAT DIES ILL THE ILL UPON
HIS OWN HEAD THE KING IS NOT TO ANSWER IT 
BUT I DO NOT DESIRE HE SHOULD ANSWER FOR ME AND
YET I DETERMINE TO FIGHT LUSTILY FOR HIM 
I MYSELF HEARD THE KING SAY HE WOULD NOT BE RANSOMED 
AY HE SAID SO TO MAKE US FIGHT CHEERFULLY BUT
WHEN OUR THROATS ARE CUT HE MAY BE RANSOMED AND WE
NEER THE WISER 
IF I LIVE TO SEE IT I WILL NEVER TRUST HIS WORD AFTER 
YOU PAY HIM THEN  THATS A PERILOUS SHOT OUT OF AN
ELDERGUN THAT A POOR AND PRIVATE DISPLEASURE CAN
DO AGAINST A MONARCH  YOU MAY AS WELL GO ABOUT TO
TURN THE SUN TO ICE WITH FANNING IN HIS FACE WITH A
PEACOCKS FEATHER  YOULL NEVER TRUST HIS WORD
AFTER  COME TIS A FOOLISH SAYING 
YOUR REPROOF IS SOMETHING TOO ROUND I SHOULD BE
ANGRY WITH YOU IF THE TIME WERE CONVENIENT 
LET IT BE A QUARREL BETWEEN US IF YOU LIVE 
I EMBRACE IT 
HOW SHALL I KNOW THEE AGAIN
GIVE ME ANY GAGE OF THINE AND I WILL WEAR IT IN MY
BONNET THEN IF EVER THOU DAREST ACKNOWLEDGE IT I
WILL MAKE IT MY QUARREL 
HERES MY GLOVE GIVE ME ANOTHER OF THINE 
THERE 
THIS WILL I ALSO WEAR IN MY CAP IF EVER THOU COME
TO ME AND SAY AFTER TOMORROW THIS IS MY GLOVE
BY THIS HAND I WILL TAKE THEE A BOX ON THE EAR 
IF EVER I LIVE TO SEE IT I WILL CHALLENGE IT 
THOU DAREST AS WELL BE HANGED 
WELL  I WILL DO IT THOUGH I TAKE THEE IN THE
KINGS COMPANY 
KEEP THY WORD FARE THEE WELL 
BE FRIENDS YOU ENGLISH FOOLS BE FRIENDS WE HAVE
FRENCH QUARRELS ENOW IF YOU COULD TELL HOW TO RECKON 
INDEED THE FRENCH MAY LAY TWENTY FRENCH CROWNS TO
ONE THEY WILL BEAT US FOR THEY BEAR THEM ON THEIR
SHOULDERS BUT IT IS NO ENGLISH TREASON TO CUT
FRENCH CROWNS AND TOMORROW THE KING HIMSELF WILL
BE A CLIPPER 
UPON THE KING  LET US OUR LIVES OUR SOULS
OUR DEBTS OUR CAREFUL WIVES
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR SINS LAY ON THE KING 
WE MUST BEAR ALL  O HARD CONDITION
TWINBORN WITH GREATNESS SUBJECT TO THE BREATH
OF EVERY FOOL WHOSE SENSE NO MORE CAN FEEL
BUT HIS OWN WRINGING  WHAT INFINITE HEARTSEASE
MUST KINGS NEGLECT THAT PRIVATE MEN ENJOY 
AND WHAT HAVE KINGS THAT PRIVATES HAVE NOT TOO
SAVE CEREMONY SAVE GENERAL CEREMONY
AND WHAT ART THOU THOU IDLE CEREMONY
WHAT KIND OF GOD ART THOU THAT SUFFERST MORE
OF MORTAL GRIEFS THAN DO THY WORSHIPPERS
WHAT ARE THY RENTS WHAT ARE THY COMINGS IN
O CEREMONY SHOW ME BUT THY WORTH 
WHAT IS THY SOUL OF ADORATION
ART THOU AUGHT ELSE BUT PLACE DEGREE AND FORM
CREATING AWE AND FEAR IN OTHER MEN
WHEREIN THOU ART LESS HAPPY BEING FEARD
THAN THEY IN FEARING 
WHAT DRINKST THOU OFT INSTEAD OF HOMAGE SWEET
BUT POISOND FLATTERY O BE SICK GREAT GREATNESS
AND BID THY CEREMONY GIVE THEE CURE 
THINKST THOU THE FIERY FEVER WILL GO OUT
WITH TITLES BLOWN FROM ADULATION
WILL IT GIVE PLACE TO FLEXURE AND LOW BENDING
CANST THOU WHEN THOU COMMANDST THE BEGGARS KNEE
COMMAND THE HEALTH OF IT NO THOU PROUD DREAM
THAT PLAYST SO SUBTLY WITH A KINGS REPOSE
I AM A KING THAT FIND THEE AND I KNOW
TIS NOT THE BALM THE SCEPTRE AND THE BALL
THE SWORD THE MACE THE CROWN IMPERIAL
THE INTERTISSUED ROBE OF GOLD AND PEARL
THE FARCED TITLE RUNNING FORE THE KING
THE THRONE HE SITS ON NOR THE TIDE OF POMP
THAT BEATS UPON THE HIGH SHORE OF THIS WORLD
NO NOT ALL THESE THRICEGORGEOUS CEREMONY
NOT ALL THESE LAID IN BED MAJESTICAL
CAN SLEEP SO SOUNDLY AS THE WRETCHED SLAVE
WHO WITH A BODY FILLD AND VACANT MIND
GETS HIM TO REST CRAMMD WITH DISTRESSFUL BREAD
NEVER SEES HORRID NIGHT THE CHILD OF HELL
BUT LIKE A LACKEY FROM THE RISE TO SET
SWEATS IN THE EYE OF PHOEBUS AND ALL NIGHT
SLEEPS IN ELYSIUM NEXT DAY AFTER DAWN
DOTH RISE AND HELP HYPERION TO HIS HORSE
AND FOLLOWS SO THE EVERRUNNING YEAR
WITH PROFITABLE LABOUR TO HIS GRAVE
AND BUT FOR CEREMONY SUCH A WRETCH
WINDING UP DAYS WITH TOIL AND NIGHTS WITH SLEEP
HAD THE FOREHAND AND VANTAGE OF A KING 
THE SLAVE A MEMBER OF THE COUNTRYS PEACE
ENJOYS IT BUT IN GROSS BRAIN LITTLE WOTS
WHAT WATCH THE KING KEEPS TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE
WHOSE HOURS THE PEASANT BEST ADVANTAGES 
MY LORD YOUR NOBLES JEALOUS OF YOUR ABSENCE

I RICHARDS BODY HAVE INTERRED ANEW
AND ON IT HAVE BESTOWD MORE CONTRITE TEARS
THAN FROM IT ISSUED FORCED DROPS OF BLOOD
FIVE HUNDRED POOR I HAVE IN YEARLY PAY
WHO TWICE ADAY THEIR WITHERD HANDS HOLD UP
TOWARD HEAVEN TO PARDON BLOOD AND I HAVE BUILT
TWO CHANTRIES WHERE THE SAD AND SOLEMN PRIESTS
SING STILL FOR RICHARDS SOUL  MORE WILL I DO
THOUGH ALL THAT I CAN DO IS NOTHING WORTH
SINCE THAT MY PENITENCE COMES AFTER ALL
IMPLORING PARDON 
MY LIEGE 
MY BROTHER GLOUCESTERS VOICE AY
I KNOW THY ERRAND I WILL GO WITH THEE
THE DAY MY FRIENDS AND ALL THINGS STAY FOR ME 
THE SUN DOTH GILD OUR ARMOUR UP MY LORDS 
MONTEZ A CHEVAL  MY HORSE  VARLET  LAQUAIS  HA 
O BRAVE SPIRIT 
VIA  LES EAUX ET LA TERRE 
RIEN PUIS LAIR ET LA FEU 
CIEL COUSIN ORLEANS 
NOW MY LORD CONSTABLE 
HARK HOW OUR STEEDS FOR PRESENT SERVICE NEIGH 
MOUNT THEM AND MAKE INCISION IN THEIR HIDES
THAT THEIR HOT BLOOD MAY SPIN IN ENGLISH EYES
AND DOUT THEM WITH SUPERFLUOUS COURAGE HA 
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE THEM WEEP OUR HORSES BLOOD
HOW SHALL WE THEN BEHOLD THEIR NATURAL TEARS
THE ENGLISH ARE EMBATTLED YOU FRENCH PEERS 
TO HORSE YOU GALLANT PRINCES  STRAIGHT TO HORSE 
DO BUT BEHOLD YON POOR AND STARVED BAND
AND YOUR FAIR SHOW SHALL SUCK AWAY THEIR SOULS
LEAVING THEM BUT THE SHALES AND HUSKS OF MEN 
THERE IS NOT WORK ENOUGH FOR ALL OUR HANDS
SCARCE BLOOD ENOUGH IN ALL THEIR SICKLY VEINS
TO GIVE EACH NAKED CURTLEAXE A STAIN
THAT OUR FRENCH GALLANTS SHALL TODAY DRAW OUT
AND SHEATHE FOR LACK OF SPORT LET US BUT BLOW ON THEM
THE VAPOUR OF OUR VALOUR WILL OERTURN THEM 
TIS POSITIVE GAINST ALL EXCEPTIONS LORDS
THAT OUR SUPERFLUOUS LACKEYS AND OUR PEASANTS
WHO IN UNNECESSARY ACTION SWARM
ABOUT OUR SQUARES OF BATTLE WERE ENOW
TO PURGE THIS FIELD OF SUCH A HILDING FOE
THOUGH WE UPON THIS MOUNTAINS BASIS BY
TOOK STAND FOR IDLE SPECULATION
BUT THAT OUR HONOURS MUST NOT  WHATS TO SAY
A VERY LITTLE LITTLE LET US DO 
AND ALL IS DONE  THEN LET THE TRUMPETS SOUND
THE TUCKET SONANCE AND THE NOTE TO MOUNT
FOR OUR APPROACH SHALL SO MUCH DARE THE FIELD
THAT ENGLAND SHALL COUCH DOWN IN FEAR AND YIELD 
WHY DO YOU STAY SO LONG MY LORDS OF FRANCE
YON ISLAND CARRIONS DESPERATE OF THEIR BONES
ILLFAVOUREDLY BECOME THE MORNING FIELD
THEIR RAGGED CURTAINS POORLY ARE LET LOOSE
AND OUR AIR SHAKES THEM PASSING SCORNFULLY
BIG MARS SEEMS BANKRUPT IN THEIR BEGGARD HOST
AND FAINTLY THROUGH A RUSTY BEAVER PEEPS
THE HORSEMEN SIT LIKE FIXED CANDLESTICKS
WITH TORCHSTAVES IN THEIR HAND AND THEIR POOR JADES
LOB DOWN THEIR HEADS DROPPING THE HIDES AND HIPS
THE GUM DOWNROPING FROM THEIR PALEDEAD EYES
AND IN THEIR PALE DULL MOUTHS THE GIMMAL BIT
LIES FOUL WITH CHEWD GRASS STILL AND MOTIONLESS
AND THEIR EXECUTORS THE KNAVISH CROWS
FLY OER THEM ALL IMPATIENT FOR THEIR HOUR 
DESCRIPTION CANNOT SUIT ITSELF IN WORDS
TO DEMONSTRATE THE LIFE OF SUCH A BATTLE
IN LIFE SO LIFELESS AS IT SHOWS ITSELF 
THEY HAVE SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND THEY STAY FOR DEATH 
SHALL WE GO SEND THEM DINNERS AND FRESH SUITS
AND GIVE THEIR FASTING HORSES PROVENDER
AND AFTER FIGHT WITH THEM
I STAY BUT FOR MY GUIDON TO THE FIELD 
I WILL THE BANNER FROM A TRUMPET TAKE
AND USE IT FOR MY HASTE  COME COME AWAY 
THE SUN IS HIGH AND WE OUTWEAR THE DAY 
WHERE IS THE KING
THE KING HIMSELF IS RODE TO VIEW THEIR BATTLE 
OF FIGHTING MEN THEY HAVE FULL THREE SCORE THOUSAND 
THERES FIVE TO ONE BESIDES THEY ALL ARE FRESH 
GODS ARM STRIKE WITH US  TIS A FEARFUL ODDS 
GOD BE WI YOU PRINCES ALL ILL TO MY CHARGE
IF WE NO MORE MEET TILL WE MEET IN HEAVEN

BUT ONE TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE MEN IN ENGLAND
THAT DO NO WORK TODAY 
WHATS HE THAT WISHES SO
MY COUSIN WESTMORELAND NO MY FAIR COUSIN
IF WE ARE MARKD TO DIE WE ARE ENOW
TO DO OUR COUNTRY LOSS AND IF TO LIVE
THE FEWER MEN THE GREATER SHARE OF HONOUR 
GODS WILL  I PRAY THEE WISH NOT ONE MAN MORE 
BY JOVE I AM NOT COVETOUS FOR GOLD
NOR CARE I WHO DOTH FEED UPON MY COST
IT YEARNS ME NOT IF MEN MY GARMENTS WEAR
SUCH OUTWARD THINGS DWELL NOT IN MY DESIRES
BUT IF IT BE A SIN TO COVET HONOUR
I AM THE MOST OFFENDING SOUL ALIVE 
NO FAITH MY COZ WISH NOT A MAN FROM ENGLAND
GODS PEACE  I WOULD NOT LOSE SO GREAT AN HONOUR
AS ONE MAN MORE METHINKS WOULD SHARE FROM ME
FOR THE BEST HOPE I HAVE  O DO NOT WISH ONE MORE 
RATHER PROCLAIM IT WESTMORELAND THROUGH MY HOST
THAT HE WHICH HATH NO STOMACH TO THIS FIGHT
LET HIM DEPART HIS PASSPORT SHALL BE MADE
AND CROWNS FOR CONVOY PUT INTO HIS PURSE
WE WOULD NOT DIE IN THAT MANS COMPANY
THAT FEARS HIS FELLOWSHIP TO DIE WITH US 
THIS DAY IS CALLED THE FEAST OF CRISPIAN
HE THAT OUTLIVES THIS DAY AND COMES SAFE HOME
WILL STAND A TIPTOE WHEN THE DAY IS NAMED
AND ROUSE HIM AT THE NAME OF CRISPIAN 
HE THAT SHALL LIVE THIS DAY AND SEE OLD AGE
WILL YEARLY ON THE VIGIL FEAST HIS NEIGHBOURS
AND SAY TOMORROW IS SAINT CRISPIAN
THEN WILL HE STRIP HIS SLEEVE AND SHOW HIS SCARS 
AND SAY THESE WOUNDS I HAD ON CRISPINS DAY 
OLD MEN FORGET YET ALL SHALL BE FORGOT
BUT HELL REMEMBER WITH ADVANTAGES
WHAT FEATS HE DID THAT DAY THEN SHALL OUR NAMES 
FAMILIAR IN HIS MOUTH AS HOUSEHOLD WORDS
HARRY THE KING BEDFORD AND EXETER
WARWICK AND TALBOT SALISBURY AND GLOUCESTER
BE IN THEIR FLOWING CUPS FRESHLY REMEMBERD 
THIS STORY SHALL THE GOOD MAN TEACH HIS SON
AND CRISPIN CRISPIAN SHALL NEER GO BY
FROM THIS DAY TO THE ENDING OF THE WORLD
BUT WE IN IT SHALL BE REMEMBERD

FOR HE TODAY THAT SHEDS HIS BLOOD WITH ME
SHALL BE MY BROTHER BE HE NEER SO VILE
THIS DAY SHALL GENTLE HIS CONDITION

WHILE THE BEAST LIVED WAS KILLED WITH HUNTING HIM 
A MANY OF OUR BODIES SHALL NO DOUBT
FIND NATIVE GRAVES UPON THE WHICH I TRUST
SHALL WITNESS LIVE IN BRASS OF THIS DAYS WORK
AND THOSE THAT LEAVE THEIR VALIANT BONES IN FRANCE
DYING LIKE MEN THOUGH BURIED IN YOUR DUNGHILLS
