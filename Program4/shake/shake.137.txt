WOULD HAVE HIM WED AGAIN 
IF YOU WOULD NOT SO
YOU PITY NOT THE STATE NOR THE REMEMBRANCE
OF HIS MOST SOVEREIGN NAME CONSIDER LITTLE
WHAT DANGERS BY HIS HIGHNESS FAIL OF ISSUE
MAY DROP UPON HIS KINGDOM AND DEVOUR
INCERTAIN LOOKERS ON  WHAT WERE MORE HOLY

WHAT HOLIER THAN FOR ROYALTYS REPAIR
FOR PRESENT COMFORT AND FOR FUTURE GOOD
TO BLESS THE BED OF MAJESTY AGAIN
WITH A SWEET FELLOW TOT

RESPECTING HER THATS GONE  BESIDES THE GODS
WILL HAVE FULFILLD THEIR SECRET PURPOSES
FOR HAS NOT THE DIVINE APOLLO SAID

THAT KING LEONTES SHALL NOT HAVE AN HEIR
TILL HIS LOST CHILD BE FOUND WHICH THAT IT SHALL
IS ALL AS MONSTROUS TO OUR HUMAN REASON
AS MY ANTIGONUS TO BREAK HIS GRAVE
AND COME AGAIN TO ME WHO ON MY LIFE
DID PERISH WITH THE INFANT  TIS YOUR COUNSEL
MY LORD SHOULD TO THE HEAVENS BE CONTRARY
OPPOSE AGAINST THEIR WILLS 
CARE NOT FOR ISSUE

GOOD PAULINA
WHO HAST THE MEMORY OF HERMIONE

BESEECH YOU SIR WERE YOU PRESENT AT THIS RELATION
I WAS BY AT THE OPENING OF THE FARDEL HEARD THE OLD
SHEPHERD DELIVER THE MANNER HOW HE FOUND IT
WHEREUPON AFTER A LITTLE AMAZEDNESS WE WERE ALL
COMMANDED OUT OF THE CHAMBER ONLY THIS METHOUGHT I
HEARD THE SHEPHERD SAY HE FOUND THE CHILD 
I WOULD MOST GLADLY KNOW THE ISSUE OF IT 
I MAKE A BROKEN DELIVERY OF THE BUSINESS BUT THE
CHANGES I PERCEIVED IN THE KING AND CAMILLO WERE
VERY NOTES OF ADMIRATION THEY SEEMED ALMOST WITH
STARING ON ONE ANOTHER TO TEAR THE CASES OF THEIR
EYES THERE WAS SPEECH IN THEIR DUMBNESS LANGUAGE
IN THEIR VERY GESTURE THEY LOOKED AS THEY HAD HEARD
OF A WORLD RANSOMED OR ONE DESTROYED A NOTABLE
PASSION OF WONDER APPEARED IN THEM BUT THE WISEST
BEHOLDER THAT KNEW NO MORE BUT SEEING COULD NOT
SAY IF THE IMPORTANCE WERE JOY OR SORROW BUT IN THE
EXTREMITY OF THE ONE IT MUST NEEDS BE 
HERE COMES A GENTLEMAN THAT HAPLY KNOWS MORE 
THE NEWS ROGERO
NOTHING BUT BONFIRES THE ORACLE IS FULFILLED THE
KINGS DAUGHTER IS FOUND SUCH A DEAL OF WONDER IS
BROKEN OUT WITHIN THIS HOUR THAT BALLADMAKERS
CANNOT BE ABLE TO EXPRESS IT 
HERE COMES THE LADY PAULINAS STEWARD HE CAN
DELIVER YOU MORE  HOW GOES IT NOW SIR THIS NEWS
WHICH IS CALLED TRUE IS SO LIKE AN OLD TALE THAT
THE VERITY OF IT IS IN STRONG SUSPICION HAS THE KING
FOUND HIS HEIR
MOST TRUE IF EVER TRUTH WERE PREGNANT BY
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WHICH YOU HEAR YOULL SWEAR YOU
SEE THERE IS SUCH UNITY IN THE PROOFS  THE MANTLE
OF QUEEN HERMIONES HER JEWEL ABOUT THE NECK OF IT
THE LETTERS OF ANTIGONUS FOUND WITH IT WHICH THEY
KNOW TO BE HIS CHARACTER THE MAJESTY OF THE
CREATURE IN RESEMBLANCE OF THE MOTHER THE AFFECTION
OF NOBLENESS WHICH NATURE SHOWS ABOVE HER BREEDING
AND MANY OTHER EVIDENCES PROCLAIM HER WITH ALL
CERTAINTY TO BE THE KINGS DAUGHTER  DID YOU SEE
THE MEETING OF THE TWO KINGS
NO 
THEN HAVE YOU LOST A SIGHT WHICH WAS TO BE SEEN
CANNOT BE SPOKEN OF  THERE MIGHT YOU HAVE BEHELD ONE
JOY CROWN ANOTHER SO AND IN SUCH MANNER THAT IT
SEEMED SORROW WEPT TO TAKE LEAVE OF THEM FOR THEIR
JOY WADED IN TEARS  THERE WAS CASTING UP OF EYES
HOLDING UP OF HANDS WITH COUNTENANCES OF SUCH
DISTRACTION THAT THEY WERE TO BE KNOWN BY GARMENT
NOT BY FAVOUR  OUR KING BEING READY TO LEAP OUT OF
HIMSELF FOR JOY OF HIS FOUND DAUGHTER AS IF THAT
JOY WERE NOW BECOME A LOSS CRIES O THY MOTHER
THY MOTHER  THEN ASKS BOHEMIA FORGIVENESS THEN
EMBRACES HIS SONINLAW THEN AGAIN WORRIES HE HIS
DAUGHTER WITH CLIPPING HER NOW HE THANKS THE OLD
SHEPHERD WHICH STANDS BY LIKE A WEATHERBITTEN
CONDUIT OF MANY KINGS REIGNS  I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH
ANOTHER ENCOUNTER WHICH LAMES REPORT TO FOLLOW IT
AND UNDOES DESCRIPTION TO DO IT 
WHAT PRAY YOU BECAME OF ANTIGONUS THAT CARRIED
HENCE THE CHILD
LIKE AN OLD TALE STILL WHICH WILL HAVE MATTER TO
REHEARSE THOUGH CREDIT BE ASLEEP AND NOT AN EAR
OPEN  HE WAS TORN TO PIECES WITH A BEAR THIS
AVOUCHES THE SHEPHERDS SON WHO HAS NOT ONLY HIS
INNOCENCE WHICH SEEMS MUCH TO JUSTIFY HIM BUT A
HANDKERCHIEF AND RINGS OF HIS THAT PAULINA KNOWS 
WHAT BECAME OF HIS BARK AND HIS FOLLOWERS
WRECKED THE SAME INSTANT OF THEIR MASTERS DEATH AND
IN THE VIEW OF THE SHEPHERD SO THAT ALL THE
INSTRUMENTS WHICH AIDED TO EXPOSE THE CHILD WERE
EVEN THEN LOST WHEN IT WAS FOUND  BUT O THE NOBLE
COMBAT THAT TWIXT JOY AND SORROW WAS FOUGHT IN
PAULINA  SHE HAD ONE EYE DECLINED FOR THE LOSS OF
HER HUSBAND ANOTHER ELEVATED THAT THE ORACLE WAS
FULFILLED SHE LIFTED THE PRINCESS FROM THE EARTH
AND SO LOCKS HER IN EMBRACING AS IF SHE WOULD PIN
HER TO HER HEART THAT SHE MIGHT NO MORE BE IN DANGER
OF LOSING 
THE DIGNITY OF THIS ACT WAS WORTH THE AUDIENCE OF
KINGS AND PRINCES FOR BY SUCH WAS IT ACTED 
ONE OF THE PRETTIEST TOUCHES OF ALL AND THAT WHICH
ANGLED FOR MINE EYES CAUGHT THE WATER THOUGH NOT
THE FISH WAS WHEN AT THE RELATION OF THE QUEENS
DEATH WITH THE MANNER HOW SHE CAME TOT BRAVELY
CONFESSED AND LAMENTED BY THE KING HOW
ATTENTIVENESS WOUNDED HIS DAUGHTER TILL FROM ONE
SIGN OF DOLOUR TO ANOTHER SHE DID WITH AN ALAS
I WOULD FAIN SAY BLEED TEARS FOR I AM SURE MY
HEART WEPT BLOOD  WHO WAS MOST MARBLE THERE CHANGED
COLOUR SOME SWOONED ALL SORROWED IF ALL THE WORLD
COULD HAVE SEEN T THE WOE HAD BEEN UNIVERSAL 
ARE THEY RETURNED TO THE COURT
NO THE PRINCESS HEARING OF HER MOTHERS STATUE
WHICH IS IN THE KEEPING OF PAULINA A PIECE MANY
YEARS IN DOING AND NOW NEWLY PERFORMED BY THAT RARE
ITALIAN MASTER JULIO ROMANO WHO HAD HE HIMSELF
ETERNITY AND COULD PUT BREATH INTO HIS WORK WOULD
BEGUILE NATURE OF HER CUSTOM SO PERFECTLY HE IS HER
APE HE SO NEAR TO HERMIONE HATH DONE HERMIONE THAT
THEY SAY ONE WOULD SPEAK TO HER AND STAND IN HOPE OF
ANSWER THITHER WITH ALL GREEDINESS OF AFFECTION
ARE THEY GONE AND THERE THEY INTEND TO SUP 
I THOUGHT SHE HAD SOME GREAT MATTER THERE IN HAND
FOR SHE HATH PRIVATELY TWICE OR THRICE A DAY EVER
SINCE THE DEATH OF HERMIONE VISITED THAT REMOVED
HOUSE  SHALL WE THITHER AND WITH OUR COMPANY PIECE
THE REJOICING
WHO WOULD BE THENCE THAT HAS THE BENEFIT OF ACCESS
EVERY WINK OF AN EYE SOME NEW GRACE WILL BE BORN
OUR ABSENCE MAKES US UNTHRIFTY TO OUR KNOWLEDGE 
LETS ALONG 
NOW HAD I NOT THE DASH OF MY FORMER LIFE IN ME
WOULD PREFERMENT DROP ON MY HEAD  I BROUGHT THE OLD
MAN AND HIS SON ABOARD THE PRINCE TOLD HIM I HEARD
THEM TALK OF A FARDEL AND I KNOW NOT WHAT BUT HE
AT THAT TIME OVERFOND OF THE SHEPHERDS DAUGHTER
