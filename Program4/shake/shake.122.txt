THE SMALLEST SCRUPLE OF HER EXCELLENCE
BUT LIKE A THRIFTY GODDESS SHE DETERMINES
HERSELF THE GLORY OF A CREDITOR
BOTH THANKS AND USE  BUT I DO BEND MY SPEECH
TO ONE THAT CAN MY PART IN HIM ADVERTISE
HOLD THEREFORE ANGELO

MAY YOUR GRACE SPEAK OF IT
MY HOLY SIR NONE BETTER KNOWS THAN YOU
HOW I HAVE EVER LOVED THE LIFE REMOVED
AND HELD IN IDLE PRICE TO HAUNT ASSEMBLIES
WHERE YOUTH AND COST AND WITLESS BRAVERY KEEPS 
I HAVE DELIVERD TO LORD ANGELO
A MAN OF STRICTURE AND FIRM ABSTINENCE
MY ABSOLUTE POWER AND PLACE HERE IN VIENNA
AND HE SUPPOSES ME TRAVELLD TO POLAND
FOR SO I HAVE STREWD IT IN THE COMMON EAR
AND SO IT IS RECEIVED  NOW PIOUS SIR
YOU WILL DEMAND OF ME WHY I DO THIS
GLADLY MY LORD 
WE HAVE STRICT STATUTES AND MOST BITING LAWS 
THE NEEDFUL BITS AND CURBS TO HEADSTRONG WEEDS
WHICH FOR THIS NINETEEN YEARS WE HAVE LET SLIP
EVEN LIKE AN OERGROWN LION IN A CAVE
THAT GOES NOT OUT TO PREY  NOW AS FOND FATHERS
HAVING BOUND UP THE THREATENING TWIGS OF BIRCH
ONLY TO STICK IT IN THEIR CHILDRENS SIGHT
FOR TERROR NOT TO USE IN TIME THE ROD
BECOMES MORE MOCKD THAN FEARD SO OUR DECREES
DEAD TO INFLICTION TO THEMSELVES ARE DEAD
AND LIBERTY PLUCKS JUSTICE BY THE NOSE
THE BABY BEATS THE NURSE AND QUITE ATHWART
GOES ALL DECORUM 
IT RESTED IN YOUR GRACE
TO UNLOOSE THIS TIEDUP JUSTICE WHEN YOU PLEASED
AND IT IN YOU MORE DREADFUL WOULD HAVE SEEMD
THAN IN LORD ANGELO 
I DO FEAR TOO DREADFUL
SITH TWAS MY FAULT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE SCOPE
TWOULD BE MY TYRANNY TO STRIKE AND GALL THEM
FOR WHAT I BID THEM DO FOR WE BID THIS BE DONE
WHEN EVIL DEEDS HAVE THEIR PERMISSIVE PASS
AND NOT THE PUNISHMENT  THEREFORE INDEED MY FATHER
I HAVE ON ANGELO IMPOSED THE OFFICE
WHO MAY IN THE AMBUSH OF MY NAME STRIKE HOME
AND YET MY NATURE NEVER IN THE FIGHT
TO DO IN SLANDER  AND TO BEHOLD HIS SWAY
I WILL AS TWERE A BROTHER OF YOUR ORDER
VISIT BOTH PRINCE AND PEOPLE THEREFORE I PRITHEE
SUPPLY ME WITH THE HABIT AND INSTRUCT ME
HOW I MAY FORMALLY IN PERSON BEAR ME
LIKE A TRUE FRIAR  MORE REASONS FOR THIS ACTION
AT OUR MORE LEISURE SHALL I RENDER YOU
ONLY THIS ONE LORD ANGELO IS PRECISE
STANDS AT A GUARD WITH ENVY SCARCE CONFESSES

IS MORE TO BREAD THAN STONE HENCE SHALL WE SEE
IF POWER CHANGE PURPOSE WHAT OUR SEEMERS BE 
AND HAVE YOU NUNS NO FARTHER PRIVILEGES

FOR EVERY PELTING PETTY OFFICER
WOULD USE HIS HEAVEN FOR THUNDER
NOTHING BUT THUNDER  MERCIFUL HEAVEN
THOU RATHER WITH THY SHARP AND SULPHUROUS BOLT
SPLITST THE UNWEDGEABLE AND GNARLED OAK
THAN THE SOFT MYRTLE BUT MAN PROUD MAN
DREST IN A LITTLE BRIEF AUTHORITY
MOST IGNORANT OF WHAT HES MOST ASSURED
HIS GLASSY ESSENCE LIKE AN ANGRY APE
PLAYS SUCH FANTASTIC TRICKS BEFORE HIGH HEAVEN
AS MAKE THE ANGELS WEEP WHO WITH OUR SPLEENS
WOULD ALL THEMSELVES LAUGH MORTAL 
  O TO HIM TO HIM WENCH  HE
WILL RELENT
HES COMING I PERCEIVE T 
  PRAY HEAVEN SHE WIN HIM 
WE CANNOT WEIGH OUR BROTHER WITH OURSELF
GREAT MEN MAY JEST WITH SAINTS TIS WIT IN THEM
BUT IN THE LESS FOUL PROFANATION 
THOURT I THE RIGHT GIRL MORE O THAT 
THAT IN THE CAPTAINS BUT A CHOLERIC WORD
WHICH IN THE SOLDIER IS FLAT BLASPHEMY 
  ART AVISED O THAT MORE ON T 
WHY DO YOU PUT THESE SAYINGS UPON ME
BECAUSE AUTHORITY THOUGH IT ERR LIKE OTHERS
HATH YET A KIND OF MEDICINE IN ITSELF
THAT SKINS THE VICE O THE TOP  GO TO YOUR BOSOM
KNOCK THERE AND ASK YOUR HEART WHAT IT DOTH KNOW
THATS LIKE MY BROTHERS FAULT IF IT CONFESS
A NATURAL GUILTINESS SUCH AS IS HIS
LET IT NOT SOUND A THOUGHT UPON YOUR TONGUE
AGAINST MY BROTHERS LIFE 
                  SHE SPEAKS AND TIS

OR STONES WHOSE RATES ARE EITHER RICH OR POOR
AS FANCY VALUES THEM BUT WITH TRUE PRAYERS
THAT SHALL BE UP AT HEAVEN AND ENTER THERE
ERE SUNRISE PRAYERS FROM PRESERVED SOULS
FROM FASTING MAIDS WHOSE MINDS ARE DEDICATE
TO NOTHING TEMPORAL 
WELL COME TO ME TOMORROW 
  GO TO TIS WELL AWAY 
HEAVEN KEEP YOUR HONOUR SAFE 
 AMEN
FOR I AM THAT WAY GOING TO TEMPTATION
WHERE PRAYERS CROSS 
AT WHAT HOUR TOMORROW
SHALL I ATTEND YOUR LORDSHIP
AT ANY TIME FORE NOON 
SAVE YOUR HONOUR 
FROM THEE EVEN FROM THY VIRTUE 
WHATS THIS WHATS THIS IS THIS HER FAULT OR MINE
THE TEMPTER OR THE TEMPTED WHO SINS MOST
HA 
NOT SHE NOR DOTH SHE TEMPT BUT IT IS I
THAT LYING BY THE VIOLET IN THE SUN
DO AS THE CARRION DOES NOT AS THE FLOWER
CORRUPT WITH VIRTUOUS SEASON  CAN IT BE
THAT MODESTY MAY MORE BETRAY OUR SENSE
THAN WOMANS LIGHTNESS HAVING WASTE GROUND ENOUGH
SHALL WE DESIRE TO RAZE THE SANCTUARY
AND PITCH OUR EVILS THERE O FIE FIE FIE 
WHAT DOST THOU OR WHAT ART THOU ANGELO
DOST THOU DESIRE HER FOULLY FOR THOSE THINGS
THAT MAKE HER GOOD O LET HER BROTHER LIVE 
THIEVES FOR THEIR ROBBERY HAVE AUTHORITY
WHEN JUDGES STEAL THEMSELVES  WHAT DO I LOVE HER
THAT I DESIRE TO HEAR HER SPEAK AGAIN
AND FEAST UPON HER EYES WHAT IST I DREAM ON
O CUNNING ENEMY THAT TO CATCH A SAINT
WITH SAINTS DOST BAIT THY HOOK  MOST DANGEROUS
IS THAT TEMPTATION THAT DOTH GOAD US ON
TO SIN IN LOVING VIRTUE NEVER COULD THE STRUMPET
WITH ALL HER DOUBLE VIGOUR ART AND NATURE
ONCE STIR MY TEMPER BUT THIS VIRTUOUS MAID
SUBDUES ME QUITE  EVEN TILL NOW
WHEN MEN WERE FOND I SMILED AND WONDERD HOW 
HAIL TO YOU PROVOST  SO I THINK YOU ARE 
I AM THE PROVOST  WHATS YOUR WILL GOOD FRIAR
BOUND BY MY CHARITY AND MY BLEST ORDER
I COME TO VISIT THE AFFLICTED SPIRITS
HERE IN THE PRISON  DO ME THE COMMON RIGHT
TO LET ME SEE THEM AND TO MAKE ME KNOW
THE NATURE OF THEIR CRIMES THAT I MAY MINISTER
TO THEM ACCORDINGLY 
I WOULD DO MORE THAN THAT IF MORE WERE NEEDFUL 
LOOK HERE COMES ONE A GENTLEWOMAN OF MINE
WHO FALLING IN THE FLAWS OF HER OWN YOUTH
HATH BLISTERD HER REPORT SHE IS WITH CHILD
AND HE THAT GOT IT SENTENCED A YOUNG MAN
MORE FIT TO DO ANOTHER SUCH OFFENCE
THAN DIE FOR THIS 
WHEN MUST HE DIE
AS I DO THINK TOMORROW 
I HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU STAY AWHILE
AND YOU SHALL BE CONDUCTED 
REPENT YOU FAIR ONE OF THE SIN YOU CARRY
I DO AND BEAR THE SHAME MOST PATIENTLY 
ILL TEACH YOU HOW YOU SHALL ARRAIGN YOUR CONSCIENCE
AND TRY YOUR PENITENCE IF IT BE SOUND
OR HOLLOWLY PUT ON 
ILL GLADLY LEARN 
LOVE YOU THE MAN THAT WRONGD YOU
YES AS I LOVE THE WOMAN THAT WRONGD HIM 
SO THEN IT SEEMS YOUR MOST OFFENCEFUL ACT
WAS MUTUALLY COMMITTED
MUTUALLY 
THEN WAS YOUR SIN OF HEAVIER KIND THAN HIS 
I DO CONFESS IT AND REPENT IT FATHER 
TIS MEET SO DAUGHTER BUT LEST YOU DO REPENT
AS THAT THE SIN HATH BROUGHT YOU TO THIS SHAME
WHICH SORROW IS ALWAYS TOWARDS OURSELVES NOT HEAVEN
SHOWING WE WOULD NOT SPARE HEAVEN AS WE LOVE IT
BUT AS WE STAND IN FEAR 
I DO REPENT ME AS IT IS AN EVIL
AND TAKE THE SHAME WITH JOY 
THERE REST 
YOUR PARTNER AS I HEAR MUST DIE TOMORROW
AND I AM GOING WITH INSTRUCTION TO HIM 
GRACE GO WITH YOU BENEDICITE 
MUST DIE TOMORROW  O INJURIOUS LOVE
THAT RESPITES ME A LIFE WHOSE VERY COMFORT
IS STILL A DYING HORROR 
TIS PITY OF HIM 
WHEN I WOULD PRAY AND THINK I THINK AND PRAY
TO SEVERAL SUBJECTS  HEAVEN HATH MY EMPTY WORDS
WHILST MY INVENTION HEARING NOT MY TONGUE

TO THY FALSE SEEMING  BLOOD THOU ART BLOOD
LETS WRITE GOOD ANGEL ON THE DEVILS HORN
TIS NOT THE DEVILS CREST 
HOW NOW  WHOS THERE
ONE ISABEL A SISTER DESIRES ACCESS TO YOU 
TEACH HER THE WAY 
O HEAVENS 
WHY DOES MY BLOOD THUS MUSTER TO MY HEART
MAKING BOTH IT UNABLE FOR ITSELF
AND DISPOSSESSING ALL MY OTHER PARTS
OF NECESSARY FITNESS
SO PLAY THE FOOLISH THRONGS WITH ONE THAT SWOONS
COME ALL TO HELP HIM AND SO STOP THE AIR
BY WHICH HE SHOULD REVIVE AND EVEN SO
THE GENERAL SUBJECT TO A WELLWISHD KING
QUIT THEIR OWN PART AND IN OBSEQUIOUS FONDNESS
CROWD TO HIS PRESENCE WHERE THEIR UNTAUGHT LOVE
MUST NEEDS APPEAR OFFENCE 
HOW NOW FAIR MAID
I AM COME TO KNOW YOUR PLEASURE

EVEN SO  HEAVEN KEEP YOUR HONOUR 
YET MAY HE LIVE AWHILE AND IT MAY BE
AS LONG AS YOU OR I YET HE MUST DIE 
UNDER YOUR SENTENCE
YEA 
WHEN I BESEECH YOU THAT IN HIS REPRIEVE
LONGER OR SHORTER HE MAY BE SO FITTED
THAT HIS SOUL SICKEN NOT 
HA  FIE THESE FILTHY VICES  IT WERE AS GOOD
TO PARDON HIM THAT HATH FROM NATURE STOLEN

THEIR SAUCY SWEETNESS THAT DO COIN HEAVENS IMAGE
IN STAMPS THAT ARE FORBID TIS ALL AS EASY
FALSELY TO TAKE AWAY A LIFE TRUE MADE

TIS SET DOWN SO IN HEAVEN BUT NOT IN EARTH 
SAY YOU SO THEN I SHALL POSE YOU QUICKLY 
WHICH HAD YOU RATHER THAT THE MOST JUST LAW

ACCOUNTANT TO THE LAW UPON THAT PAIN

FINDING YOURSELF DESIRED OF SUCH A PERSON
WHOSE CREDIT WITH THE JUDGE OR OWN GREAT PLACE
COULD FETCH YOUR BROTHER FROM THE MANACLES
OF THE ALLBUILDING LAW AND THAT THERE WERE
NO EARTHLY MEAN TO SAVE HIM BUT THAT EITHER
YOU MUST LAY DOWN THE TREASURES OF YOUR BODY
TO THIS SUPPOSED OR ELSE TO LET HIM SUFFER
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

THAT IS WERE I UNDER THE TERMS OF DEATH
THE IMPRESSION OF KEEN WHIPS ILD WEAR AS RUBIES
AND STRIP MYSELF TO DEATH AS TO A BED
THAT LONGING HAVE BEEN SICK FOR ERE ILD YIELD
MY BODY UP TO SHAME 
THEN MUST YOUR BROTHER DIE 
AND TWERE THE CHEAPER WAY

NAY WOMEN ARE FRAIL TOO

YET HATH HE IN HIM SUCH A MIND OF HONOUR 
THAT HAD HE TWENTY HEADS TO TENDER DOWN
ON TWENTY BLOODY BLOCKS HELD YIELD THEM UP
BEFORE HIS SISTER SHOULD HER BODY STOOP
TO SUCH ABHORRD POLLUTION 
THEN ISABEL LIVE CHASTE AND BROTHER DIE
MORE THAN OUR BROTHER IS OUR CHASTITY 
ILL TELL HIM YET OF ANGELOS REQUEST
AND FIT HIS MIND TO DEATH FOR HIS SOULS REST 
SO THEN YOU HOPE OF PARDON FROM LORD ANGELO
THE MISERABLE HAVE NO OTHER MEDICINE

SERVILE TO ALL THE SKYEY INFLUENCES
THAT DOST THIS HABITATION WHERE THOU KEEPST
HOURLY AFFLICT MERELY THOU ART DEATHS FOOL
FOR HIM THOU LABOURST BY THY FLIGHT TO SHUN
AND YET RUNNST TOWARD HIM STILL  THOU ART NOT NOBLE
FOR ALL THE ACCOMMODATIONS THAT THOU BEARST

FOR THOU DOST FEAR THE SOFT AND TENDER FORK
OF A POOR WORM  THY BEST OF REST IS SLEEP

NAY IT IS TEN TIMES TRUE FOR TRUTH IS TRUTH
TO THE END OF RECKONING 
AWAY WITH HER  POOR SOUL
SHE SPEAKS THIS IN THE INFIRMITY OF SENSE 
O PRINCE I CONJURE THEE AS THOU BELIEVEST
THERE IS ANOTHER COMFORT THAN THIS WORLD
THAT THOU NEGLECT ME NOT WITH THAT OPINION
THAT I AM TOUCHD WITH MADNESS  MAKE NOT IMPOSSIBLE
THAT WHICH BUT SEEMS UNLIKE TIS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
BUT ONE THE WICKEDST CAITIFF ON THE GROUND
MAY SEEM AS SHY AS GRAVE AS JUST AS ABSOLUTE
AS ANGELO EVEN SO MAY ANGELO
IN ALL HIS DRESSINGS CHARACTS TITLES FORMS
BE AN ARCHVILLAIN BELIEVE IT ROYAL PRINCE
IF HE BE LESS HES NOTHING BUT HES MORE
HAD I MORE NAME FOR BADNESS 
BY MINE HONESTY
IF SHE BE MAD AS I BELIEVE NO OTHER 
HER MADNESS HATH THE ODDEST FRAME OF SENSE
SUCH A DEPENDENCY OF THING ON THING
AS EER I HEARD IN MADNESS 
O GRACIOUS DUKE
HARP NOT ON THAT NOR DO NOT BANISH REASON
FOR INEQUALITY BUT LET YOUR REASON SERVE
TO MAKE THE TRUTH APPEAR WHERE IT SEEMS HID
AND HIDE THE FALSE SEEMS TRUE 
MANY THAT ARE NOT MAD
HAVE SURE MORE LACK OF REASON  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
I AM THE SISTER OF ONE CLAUDIO
CONDEMND UPON THE ACT OF FORNICATION
TO LOSE HIS HEAD CONDEMND BY ANGELO
I IN PROBATION OF A SISTERHOOD
WAS SENT TO BY MY BROTHER ONE LUCIO
AS THEN THE MESSENGER 
THATS I ANT LIKE YOUR GRACE
I CAME TO HER FROM CLAUDIO AND DESIRED HER
TO TRY HER GRACIOUS FORTUNE WITH LORD ANGELO
FOR HER POOR BROTHERS PARDON 
THATS HE INDEED 
YOU WERE NOT BID TO SPEAK 
NO MY GOOD LORD
NOR WISHD TO HOLD MY PEACE 
I WISH YOU NOW THEN
PRAY YOU TAKE NOTE OF IT AND WHEN YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF PRAY HEAVEN YOU THEN
BE PERFECT 
I WARRANT YOUR HONOUR 
THE WARRANTS FOR YOURSELF TAKE HEED TOT 
THIS GENTLEMAN TOLD SOMEWHAT OF MY TALE 
RIGHT 
IT MAY BE RIGHT BUT YOU ARE I THE WRONG
TO SPEAK BEFORE YOUR TIME  PROCEED 
I WENT
TO THIS PERNICIOUS CAITIFF DEPUTY 
THATS SOMEWHAT MADLY SPOKEN 
PARDON IT
THE PHRASE IS TO THE MATTER 
MENDED AGAIN  THE MATTER PROCEED 
IN BRIEF TO SET THE NEEDLESS PROCESS BY
HOW I PERSUADED HOW I PRAYD AND KNEELD
HOW HE REFELLD ME AND HOW I REPLIED 
FOR THIS WAS OF MUCH LENGTH THE VILE CONCLUSION
I NOW BEGIN WITH GRIEF AND SHAME TO UTTER
HE WOULD NOT BUT BY GIFT OF MY CHASTE BODY
TO HIS CONCUPISCIBLE INTEMPERATE LUST
RELEASE MY BROTHER AND AFTER MUCH DEBATEMENT
MY SISTERLY REMORSE CONFUTES MINE HONOUR
AND I DID YIELD TO HIM BUT THE NEXT MORN BETIMES
HIS PURPOSE SURFEITING HE SENDS A WARRANT
FOR MY POOR BROTHERS HEAD 
THIS IS MOST LIKELY 
O THAT IT WERE AS LIKE AS IT IS TRUE 
BY HEAVEN FOND WRETCH THOU KNOWIST NOT WHAT THOU SPEAKST
OR ELSE THOU ART SUBORND AGAINST HIS HONOUR
IN HATEFUL PRACTISE  FIRST HIS INTEGRITY
STANDS WITHOUT BLEMISH  NEXT IT IMPORTS NO REASON
THAT WITH SUCH VEHEMENCY HE SHOULD PURSUE
FAULTS PROPER TO HIMSELF IF HE HAD SO OFFENDED
HE WOULD HAVE WEIGHD THY BROTHER BY HIMSELF
AND NOT HAVE CUT HIM OFF  SOME ONE HATH SET YOU ON
CONFESS THE TRUTH AND SAY BY WHOSE ADVICE
THOU CAMEST HERE TO COMPLAIN 
AND IS THIS ALL
THEN O YOU BLESSED MINISTERS ABOVE
KEEP ME IN PATIENCE AND WITH RIPEND TIME
UNFOLD THE EVIL WHICH IS HERE WRAPT UP
IN COUNTENANCE  HEAVEN SHIELD YOUR GRACE FROM WOE
AS I THUS WRONGD HENCE UNBELIEVED GO 
I KNOW YOULD FAIN BE GONE  AN OFFICER 
TO PRISON WITH HER  SHALL WE THUS PERMIT
A BLASTING AND A SCANDALOUS BREATH TO FALL
ON HIM SO NEAR US THIS NEEDS MUST BE A PRACTISE 
WHO KNEW OF YOUR INTENT AND COMING HITHER

AND TO SET ON THIS WRETCHED WOMAN HERE

BUT YESTERNIGHT MY LORD SHE AND THAT FRIAR

THAN LET HIM SO BE LOST  O MOST KIND MAID
IT WAS THE SWIFT CELERITY OF HIS DEATH
WHICH I DID THINK WITH SLOWER FOOT CAME ON
THAT BRAIND MY PURPOSE  BUT PEACE BE WITH HIM 
THAT LIFE IS BETTER LIFE PAST FEARING DEATH
THAN THAT WHICH LIVES TO FEAR MAKE IT YOUR COMFORT
SO HAPPY IS YOUR BROTHER 
I DO MY LORD 
FOR THIS NEWMARRIED MAN APPROACHING HERE
WHOSE SALT IMAGINATION YET HATH WRONGD
YOUR WELL DEFENDED HONOUR YOU MUST PARDON
FOR MARIANAS SAKE BUT AS HE ADJUDGED YOUR BROTHER 
BEING CRIMINAL IN DOUBLE VIOLATION
OF SACRED CHASTITY AND OF PROMISEBREACH
THEREON DEPENDENT FOR YOUR BROTHERS LIFE 
THE VERY MERCY OF THE LAW CRIES OUT
MOST AUDIBLE EVEN FROM HIS PROPER TONGUE
AN ANGELO FOR CLAUDIO DEATH FOR DEATH 
HASTE STILL PAYS HASTE AND LEISURE ANSWERS LEISURE
LIKE DOTH QUIT LIKE AND MEASURE STILL FOR MEASURE 
THEN ANGELO THY FAULTS THUS MANIFESTED
WHICH THOUGH THOU WOULDST DENY DENIES THEE VANTAGE 
WE DO CONDEMN THEE TO THE VERY BLOCK
WHERE CLAUDIO STOOPD TO DEATH AND WITH LIKE HASTE 
AWAY WITH HIM 
O MY MOST GRACIOUS LORD
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT MOCK ME WITH A HUSBAND 
IT IS YOUR HUSBAND MOCKD YOU WITH A HUSBAND 
CONSENTING TO THE SAFEGUARD OF YOUR HONOUR
I THOUGHT YOUR MARRIAGE FIT ELSE IMPUTATION
FOR THAT HE KNEW YOU MIGHT REPROACH YOUR LIFE
AND CHOKE YOUR GOOD TO COME FOR HIS POSSESSIONS
ALTHOUGH BY CONFISCATION THEY ARE OURS
WE DO INSTATE AND WIDOW YOU WITHAL
TO BUY YOU A BETTER HUSBAND 
O MY DEAR LORD
I CRAVE NO OTHER NOR NO BETTER MAN 
NEVER CRAVE HIM WE ARE DEFINITIVE 
GENTLE MY LIEGE 
YOU DO BUT LOSE YOUR LABOUR 
AWAY WITH HIM TO DEATH 
NOW SIR TO YOU 
O MY GOOD LORD  SWEET ISABEL TAKE MY PART
LEND ME YOUR KNEES AND ALL MY LIFE TO COME
ILL LEND YOU ALL MY LIFE TO DO YOU SERVICE 
AGAINST ALL SENSE YOU DO IMPORTUNE HER
SHOULD SHE KNEEL DOWN IN MERCY OF THIS FACT
HER BROTHERS GHOST HIS PAVED BED WOULD BREAK
AND TAKE HER HENCE IN HORROR 
ISABEL
SWEET ISABEL DO YET BUT KNEEL BY ME
HOLD UP YOUR HANDS SAY NOTHING ILL SPEAK ALL 
THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOULDED OUT OF FAULTS
AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER
FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD SO MAY MY HUSBAND 
O ISABEL WILL YOU NOT LEND A KNEE

MOST BOUNTEOUS SIR
LOOK IF IT PLEASE YOU ON THIS MAN CONDEMND
AS IF MY BROTHER LIVED I PARTLY THINK
A DUE SINCERITY GOVERND HIS DEEDS
TILL HE DID LOOK ON ME SINCE IT IS SO
LET HIM NOT DIE  MY BROTHER HAD BUT JUSTICE
IN THAT HE DID THE THING FOR WHICH HE DIED
FOR ANGELO
HIS ACT DID NOT OERTAKE HIS BAD INTENT
AND MUST BE BURIED BUT AS AN INTENT
THAT PERISHD BY THE WAY THOUGHTS ARE NO SUBJECTS
INTENTS BUT MERELY THOUGHTS 
MERELY MY LORD 
YOUR SUITS UNPROFITABLE STAND UP I SAY 
I HAVE BETHOUGHT ME OF ANOTHER FAULT 
PROVOST HOW CAME IT CLAUDIO WAS BEHEADED
AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR
IT WAS COMMANDED SO 
HAD YOU A SPECIAL WARRANT FOR THE DEED
NO MY GOOD LORD IT WAS BY PRIVATE MESSAGE 
FOR WHICH I DO DISCHARGE YOU OF YOUR OFFICE
GIVE UP YOUR KEYS 
PARDON ME NOBLE LORD
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAULT BUT KNEW IT NOT
YET DID REPENT ME AFTER MORE ADVICE
FOR TESTIMONY WHEREOF ONE IN THE PRISON

I HAVE RESERVED ALIVE 
WHATS HE
HIS NAME IS BARNARDINE 
I WOULD THOU HADST DONE SO BY CLAUDIO 
GO FETCH HIM HITHER LET ME LOOK UPON HIM 
I AM SORRY ONE SO LEARNED AND SO WISE
AS YOU LORD ANGELO HAVE STILL APPEARD
SHOULD SLIP SO GROSSLY BOTH IN THE HEAT OF BLOOD 
AND LACK OF TEMPERD JUDGMENT AFTERWARD 
I AM SORRY THAT SUCH SORROW I PROCURE
AND SO DEEP STICKS IT IN MY PENITENT HEART
THAT I CRAVE DEATH MORE WILLINGLY THAN MERCY
TIS MY DESERVING AND I DO ENTREAT IT 
WHICH IS THAT BARNARDINE
THIS MY LORD 
THERE WAS A FRIAR TOLD ME OF THIS MAN 
SIRRAH THOU ART SAID TO HAVE A STUBBORN SOUL 
THAT APPREHENDS NO FURTHER THAN THIS WORLD
AND SQUAREST THY LIFE ACCORDING  THOURT CONDEMND
BUT FOR THOSE EARTHLY FAULTS I QUIT THEM ALL
AND PRAY THEE TAKE THIS MERCY TO PROVIDE
FOR BETTER TIMES TO COME  FRIAR ADVISE HIM
I LEAVE HIM TO YOUR HAND  WHAT MUFFLED FELLOWS THAT
THIS IS ANOTHER PRISONER THAT I SAVED 
WHO SHOULD HAVE DIED WHEN CLAUDIO LOST HIS HEAD
AS LIKE ALMOST TO CLAUDIO AS HIMSELF

GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND SAY YOU WILL BE MINE 
HE IS MY BROTHER TOO BUT FITTER TIME FOR THAT 
BY THIS LORD ANGELO PERCEIVES HES SAFE
