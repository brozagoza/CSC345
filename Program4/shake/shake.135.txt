LOVE GOT SO SWEET AS WHEN DESIRE DID SUE 
THEREFORE THIS MAXIM OUT OF LOVE I TEACH
ACHIEVEMENT IS COMMAND UNGAIND BESEECH
THEN THOUGH MY HEARTS CONTENT FIRM LOVE DOTH BEAR
NOTHING OF THAT SHALL FROM MINE EYES APPEAR 
PRINCES
WHAT GRIEF HATH SET THE JAUNDICE ON YOUR CHEEKS
THE AMPLE PROPOSITION THAT HOPE MAKES
IN ALL DESIGNS BEGUN ON EARTH BELOW
FAILS IN THE PROMISED LARGENESS CHEQUES AND DISASTERS
GROW IN THE VEINS OF ACTIONS HIGHEST REARD
AS KNOTS BY THE CONFLUX OF MEETING SAP
INFECT THE SOUND PINE AND DIVERT HIS GRAIN
TORTIVE AND ERRANT FROM HIS COURSE OF GROWTH 
NOR PRINCES IS IT MATTER NEW TO US
THAT WE COME SHORT OF OUR SUPPOSE SO FAR
THAT AFTER SEVEN YEARS SIEGE YET TROY WALLS STAND
SITH EVERY ACTION THAT HATH GONE BEFORE
WHEREOF WE HAVE RECORD TRIAL DID DRAW
BIAS AND THWART NOT ANSWERING THE AIM
AND THAT UNBODIED FIGURE OF THE THOUGHT
THAT GAVET SURMISED SHAPE  WHY THEN YOU PRINCES
DO YOU WITH CHEEKS ABASHD BEHOLD OUR WORKS
AND CALL THEM SHAMES WHICH ARE INDEED NOUGHT ELSE
BUT THE PROTRACTIVE TRIALS OF GREAT JOVE
TO FIND PERSISTIVE CONSTANCY IN MEN
THE FINENESS OF WHICH METAL IS NOT FOUND
IN FORTUNES LOVE FOR THEN THE BOLD AND COWARD
THE WISE AND FOOL THE ARTIST AND UNREAD
THE HARD AND SOFT SEEM ALL AFFINED AND KIN
BUT IN THE WIND AND TEMPEST OF HER FROWN
DISTINCTION WITH A BROAD AND POWERFUL FAN
PUFFING AT ALL WINNOWS THE LIGHT AWAY
AND WHAT HATH MASS OR MATTER BY ITSELF
LIES RICH IN VIRTUE AND UNMINGLED 
WITH DUE OBSERVANCE OF THY GODLIKE SEAT
GREAT AGAMEMNON NESTOR SHALL APPLY
THY LATEST WORDS  IN THE REPROOF OF CHANCE
LIES THE TRUE PROOF OF MEN THE SEA BEING SMOOTH
HOW MANY SHALLOW BAUBLE BOATS DARE SAIL
UPON HER PATIENT BREAST MAKING THEIR WAY
WITH THOSE OF NOBLER BULK 
BUT LET THE RUFFIAN BOREAS ONCE ENRAGE
THE GENTLE THETIS AND ANON BEHOLD
THE STRONGRIBBD BARK THROUGH LIQUID MOUNTAINS CUT
BOUNDING BETWEEN THE TWO MOIST ELEMENTS
LIKE PERSEUS HORSE WHERES THEN THE SAUCY BOAT
WHOSE WEAK UNTIMBERD SIDES BUT EVEN NOW
CORIVALLD GREATNESS EITHER TO HARBOUR FLED
OR MADE A TOAST FOR NEPTUNE  EVEN SO
DOTH VALOURS SHOW AND VALOURS WORTH DIVIDE
IN STORMS OF FORTUNE FOR IN HER RAY AND BRIGHTNESS
THE HERD HATH MORE ANNOYANCE BY THE BREEZE
THAN BY THE TIGER BUT WHEN THE SPLITTING WIND
MAKES FLEXIBLE THE KNEES OF KNOTTED OAKS
AND FLIES FLED UNDER SHADE WHY THEN THE THING OF COURAGE
AS ROUSED WITH RAGE WITH RAGE DOTH SYMPATHIZE
AND WITH AN ACCENT TUNED IN SELFSAME KEY
RETORTS TO CHIDING FORTUNE 
AGAMEMNON
THOU GREAT COMMANDER NERVE AND BONE OF GREECE
HEART OF OUR NUMBERS SOUL AND ONLY SPIRIT 
IN WHOM THE TEMPERS AND THE MINDS OF ALL
SHOULD BE SHUT UP HEAR WHAT ULYSSES SPEAKS 
BESIDES THE APPLAUSE AND APPROBATION TO WHICH
MOST MIGHTY FOR THY PLACE AND SWAY
AND THOU MOST REVEREND FOR THY STRETCHDOUT LIFE
I GIVE TO BOTH YOUR SPEECHES WHICH WERE SUCH
AS AGAMEMNON AND THE HAND OF GREECE
SHOULD HOLD UP HIGH IN BRASS AND SUCH AGAIN
AS VENERABLE NESTOR HATCHD IN SILVER
SHOULD WITH A BOND OF AIR STRONG AS THE AXLETREE
ON WHICH HEAVEN RIDES KNIT ALL THE GREEKISH EARS
TO HIS EXPERIENCED TONGUE YET LET IT PLEASE BOTH
THOU GREAT AND WISE TO HEAR ULYSSES SPEAK 
SPEAK PRINCE OF ITHACA AND BET OF LESS EXPECT
THAT MATTER NEEDLESS OF IMPORTLESS BURDEN
DIVIDE THY LIPS THAN WE ARE CONFIDENT
WHEN RANK THERSITES OPES HIS MASTIC JAWS
WE SHALL HEAR MUSIC WIT AND ORACLE 
TROY YET UPON HIS BASIS HAD BEEN DOWN
AND THE GREAT HECTORS SWORD HAD LACKD A MASTER
BUT FOR THESE INSTANCES 
THE SPECIALTY OF RULE HATH BEEN NEGLECTED
AND LOOK HOW MANY GRECIAN TENTS DO STAND
HOLLOW UPON THIS PLAIN SO MANY HOLLOW FACTIONS 
WHEN THAT THE GENERAL IS NOT LIKE THE HIVE
TO WHOM THE FORAGERS SHALL ALL REPAIR
WHAT HONEY IS EXPECTED DEGREE BEING VIZARDED
THE UNWORTHIEST SHOWS AS FAIRLY IN THE MASK 
THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES THE PLANETS AND THIS CENTRE
OBSERVE DEGREE PRIORITY AND PLACE
INSISTURE COURSE PROPORTION SEASON FORM
OFFICE AND CUSTOM IN ALL LINE OF ORDER
AND THEREFORE IS THE GLORIOUS PLANET SOL
IN NOBLE EMINENCE ENTHRONED AND SPHERED
AMIDST THE OTHER WHOSE MEDICINABLE EYE
CORRECTS THE ILL ASPECTS OF PLANETS EVIL
AND POSTS LIKE THE COMMANDMENT OF A KING
SANS CHEQUE TO GOOD AND BAD BUT WHEN THE PLANETS
IN EVIL MIXTURE TO DISORDER WANDER
WHAT PLAGUES AND WHAT PORTENTS  WHAT MUTINY 
WHAT RAGING OF THE SEA  SHAKING OF EARTH 
COMMOTION IN THE WINDS  FRIGHTS CHANGES HORRORS
DIVERT AND CRACK REND AND DERACINATE
THE UNITY AND MARRIED CALM OF STATES
QUITE FROM THEIR FIXURE  O WHEN DEGREE IS SHAKED
WHICH IS THE LADDER TO ALL HIGH DESIGNS
THEN ENTERPRISE IS SICK  HOW COULD COMMUNITIES
DEGREES IN SCHOOLS AND BROTHERHOODS IN CITIES
PEACEFUL COMMERCE FROM DIVIDABLE SHORES
THE PRIMOGENITIVE AND DUE OF BIRTH
PREROGATIVE OF AGE CROWNS SCEPTRES LAURELS
BUT BY DEGREE STAND IN AUTHENTIC PLACE
TAKE BUT DEGREE AWAY UNTUNE THAT STRING
AND HARK WHAT DISCORD FOLLOWS  EACH THING MEETS
IN MERE OPPUGNANCY THE BOUNDED WATERS
SHOULD LIFT THEIR BOSOMS HIGHER THAN THE SHORES
AND MAKE A SOP OF ALL THIS SOLID GLOBE
STRENGTH SHOULD BE LORD OF IMBECILITY
AND THE RUDE SON SHOULD STRIKE HIS FATHER DEAD
FORCE SHOULD BE RIGHT OR RATHER RIGHT AND WRONG
BETWEEN WHOSE ENDLESS JAR JUSTICE RESIDES
SHOULD LOSE THEIR NAMES AND SO SHOULD JUSTICE TOO 
THEN EVERY THING INCLUDES ITSELF IN POWER
POWER INTO WILL WILL INTO APPETITE
AND APPETITE AN UNIVERSAL WOLF
SO DOUBLY SECONDED WITH WILL AND POWER
MUST MAKE PERFORCE AN UNIVERSAL PREY
AND LAST EAT UP HIMSELF  GREAT AGAMEMNON
THIS CHAOS WHEN DEGREE IS SUFFOCATE
FOLLOWS THE CHOKING 
AND THIS NEGLECTION OF DEGREE IT IS
THAT BY A PACE GOES BACKWARD WITH A PURPOSE
IT HATH TO CLIMB  THE GENERALS DISDAIND
BY HIM ONE STEP BELOW HE BY THE NEXT
THAT NEXT BY HIM BENEATH SO EVERY STEP
EXAMPLED BY THE FIRST PACE THAT IS SICK
OF HIS SUPERIOR GROWS TO AN ENVIOUS FEVER
OF PALE AND BLOODLESS EMULATION
AND TIS THIS FEVER THAT KEEPS TROY ON FOOT
NOT HER OWN SINEWS  TO END A TALE OF LENGTH
TROY IN OUR WEAKNESS STANDS NOT IN HER STRENGTH 
MOST WISELY HATH ULYSSES HERE DISCOVERD
THE FEVER WHEREOF ALL OUR POWER IS SICK 
THE NATURE OF THE SICKNESS FOUND ULYSSES
WHAT IS THE REMEDY
THE GREAT ACHILLES WHOM OPINION CROWNS
THE SINEW AND THE FOREHAND OF OUR HOST
HAVING HIS EAR FULL OF HIS AIRY FAME
GROWS DAINTY OF HIS WORTH AND IN HIS TENT
LIES MOCKING OUR DESIGNS WITH HIM PATROCLUS
UPON A LAZY BED THE LIVELONG DAY
BREAKS SCURRIL JESTS
AND WITH RIDICULOUS AND AWKWARD ACTION
WHICH SLANDERER HE IMITATION CALLS
HE PAGEANTS US  SOMETIME GREAT AGAMEMNON
THY TOPLESS DEPUTATION HE PUTS ON
AND LIKE A STRUTTING PLAYER WHOSE CONCEIT
LIES IN HIS HAMSTRING AND DOTH THINK IT RICH
TO HEAR THE WOODEN DIALOGUE AND SOUND
TWIXT HIS STRETCHD FOOTING AND THE SCAFFOLDAGE 
SUCH TOBEPITIED AND OERWRESTED SEEMING
HE ACTS THY GREATNESS IN AND WHEN HE SPEAKS
TIS LIKE A CHIME AMENDING WITH TERMS UNSQUARED
WHICH FROM THE TONGUE OF ROARING TYPHON DROPPD
WOULD SEEM HYPERBOLES  AT THIS FUSTY STUFF
THE LARGE ACHILLES ON HIS PRESSD BED LOLLING
FROM HIS DEEP CHEST LAUGHS OUT A LOUD APPLAUSE
CRIES EXCELLENT  TIS AGAMEMNON JUST 
NOW PLAY ME NESTOR HEM AND STROKE THY BEARD
AS HE BEING DREST TO SOME ORATION 
THATS DONE AS NEAR AS THE EXTREMEST ENDS
OF PARALLELS AS LIKE AS VULCAN AND HIS WIFE
YET GOD ACHILLES STILL CRIES EXCELLENT 
TIS NESTOR RIGHT  NOW PLAY HIM ME PATROCLUS
ARMING TO ANSWER IN A NIGHT ALARM 
AND THEN FORSOOTH THE FAINT DEFECTS OF AGE
MUST BE THE SCENE OF MIRTH TO COUGH AND SPIT
AND WITH A PALSYFUMBLING ON HIS GORGET
SHAKE IN AND OUT THE RIVET AND AT THIS SPORT
SIR VALOUR DIES CRIES O ENOUGH PATROCLUS
OR GIVE ME RIBS OF STEEL  I SHALL SPLIT ALL
IN PLEASURE OF MY SPLEEN  AND IN THIS FASHION
ALL OUR ABILITIES GIFTS NATURES SHAPES
SEVERALS AND GENERALS OF GRACE EXACT
ACHIEVEMENTS PLOTS ORDERS PREVENTIONS
EXCITEMENTS TO THE FIELD OR SPEECH FOR TRUCE
SUCCESS OR LOSS WHAT IS OR IS NOT SERVES
AS STUFF FOR THESE TWO TO MAKE PARADOXES 
AND IN THE IMITATION OF THESE TWAIN 
WHO AS ULYSSES SAYS OPINION CROWNS
WITH AN IMPERIAL VOICE MANY ARE INFECT 
AJAX IS GROWN SELFWILLD AND BEARS HIS HEAD
IN SUCH A REIN IN FULL AS PROUD A PLACE
AS BROAD ACHILLES KEEPS HIS TENT LIKE HIM
MAKES FACTIOUS FEASTS RAILS ON OUR STATE OF WAR
BOLD AS AN ORACLE AND SETS THERSITES
A SLAVE WHOSE GALL COINS SLANDERS LIKE A MINT
TO MATCH US IN COMPARISONS WITH DIRT
TO WEAKEN AND DISCREDIT OUR EXPOSURE
HOW RANK SOEVER ROUNDED IN WITH DANGER 
THEY TAX OUR POLICY AND CALL IT COWARDICE
COUNT WISDOM AS NO MEMBER OF THE WAR
FORESTALL PRESCIENCE AND ESTEEM NO ACT
BUT THAT OF HAND THE STILL AND MENTAL PARTS
THAT DO CONTRIVE HOW MANY HANDS SHALL STRIKE
WHEN FITNESS CALLS THEM ON AND KNOW BY MEASURE
OF THEIR OBSERVANT TOIL THE ENEMIES WEIGHT 
WHY THIS HATH NOT A FINGERS DIGNITY
THEY CALL THIS BEDWORK MAPPERY CLOSETWAR
SO THAT THE RAM THAT BATTERS DOWN THE WALL
FOR THE GREAT SWING AND RUDENESS OF HIS POISE
THEY PLACE BEFORE HIS HAND THAT MADE THE ENGINE
OR THOSE THAT WITH THE FINENESS OF THEIR SOULS
BY REASON GUIDE HIS EXECUTION 
LET THIS BE GRANTED AND ACHILLES HORSE
MAKES MANY THETIS SONS 
WHAT TRUMPET LOOK MENELAUS 
FROM TROY 
WHAT WOULD YOU FORE OUR TENT
IS THIS GREAT AGAMEMNONS TENT I PRAY YOU
EVEN THIS 
MAY ONE THAT IS A HERALD AND A PRINCE
DO A FAIR MESSAGE TO HIS KINGLY EARS
WITH SURETY STRONGER THAN ACHILLES ARM
FORE ALL THE GREEKISH HEADS WHICH WITH ONE VOICE
CALL AGAMEMNON HEAD AND GENERAL 
FAIR LEAVE AND LARGE SECURITY  HOW MAY
A STRANGER TO THOSE MOST IMPERIAL LOOKS
KNOW THEM FROM EYES OF OTHER MORTALS
HOW 
AY
I ASK THAT I MIGHT WAKEN REVERENCE
AND BID THE CHEEK BE READY WITH A BLUSH
MODEST AS MORNING WHEN SHE COLDLY EYES
THE YOUTHFUL PHOEBUS
WHICH IS THAT GOD IN OFFICE GUIDING MEN
WHICH IS THE HIGH AND MIGHTY AGAMEMNON
THIS TROJAN SCORNS US OR THE MEN OF TROY
ARE CEREMONIOUS COURTIERS 
COURTIERS AS FREE AS DEBONAIR UNARMD
AS BENDING ANGELS THATS THEIR FAME IN PEACE
BUT WHEN THEY WOULD SEEM SOLDIERS THEY HAVE GALLS
GOOD ARMS STRONG JOINTS TRUE SWORDS AND
JOVES ACCORD
NOTHING SO FULL OF HEART  BUT PEACE AENEAS
PEACE TROJAN LAY THY FINGER ON THY LIPS 
THE WORTHINESS OF PRAISE DISTAINS HIS WORTH
IF THAT THE PRAISED HIMSELF BRING THE PRAISE FORTH
BUT WHAT THE REPINING ENEMY COMMENDS
THAT BREATH FAME BLOWS THAT PRAISE SOLE SURE
TRANSCENDS 
SIR YOU OF TROY CALL YOU YOURSELF AENEAS
AY GREEK THAT IS MY NAME 
WHATS YOUR AFFAIR I PRAY YOU
SIR PARDON TIS FOR AGAMEMNONS EARS 
HE HEARS NAUGHT PRIVATELY THAT COMES FROM TROY 
NOR I FROM TROY COME NOT TO WHISPER HIM
I BRING A TRUMPET TO AWAKE HIS EAR
TO SET HIS SENSE ON THE ATTENTIVE BENT
AND THEN TO SPEAK 
SPEAK FRANKLY AS THE WIND
IT IS NOT AGAMEMNONS SLEEPING HOUR
THAT THOU SHALT KNOW  TROJAN HE IS AWAKE
HE TELLS THEE SO HIMSELF 
TRUMPET BLOW LOUD
SEND THY BRASS VOICE THROUGH ALL THESE LAZY TENTS
AND EVERY GREEK OF METTLE LET HIM KNOW
WHAT TROY MEANS FAIRLY SHALL BE SPOKE ALOUD 
WE HAVE GREAT AGAMEMNON HERE IN TROY
A PRINCE CALLD HECTOR PRIAM IS HIS FATHER 
WHO IN THIS DULL AND LONGCONTINUED TRUCE
IS RUSTY GROWN HE BADE ME TAKE A TRUMPET
AND TO THIS PURPOSE SPEAK  KINGS PRINCES LORDS 
IF THERE BE ONE AMONG THE FAIRST OF GREECE
THAT HOLDS HIS HONOUR HIGHER THAN HIS EASE
THAT SEEKS HIS PRAISE MORE THAN HE FEARS HIS PERIL
THAT KNOWS HIS VALOUR AND KNOWS NOT HIS FEAR
THAT LOVES HIS MISTRESS MORE THAN IN CONFESSION
WITH TRUANT VOWS TO HER OWN LIPS HE LOVES
AND DARE AVOW HER BEAUTY AND HER WORTH
IN OTHER ARMS THAN HERS TO HIM THIS CHALLENGE 
HECTOR IN VIEW OF TROJANS AND OF GREEKS
SHALL MAKE IT GOOD OR DO HIS BEST TO DO IT
HE HATH A LADY WISER FAIRER TRUER
THAN EVER GREEK DID COMPASS IN HIS ARMS
AND WILL TOMORROW WITH HIS TRUMPET CALL
MIDWAY BETWEEN YOUR TENTS AND WALLS OF TROY
TO ROUSE A GRECIAN THAT IS TRUE IN LOVE
IF ANY COME HECTOR SHALL HONOUR HIM
IF NONE HELL SAY IN TROY WHEN HE RETIRES
THE GRECIAN DAMES ARE SUNBURNT AND NOT WORTH
THE SPLINTER OF A LANCE  EVEN SO MUCH 
THIS SHALL BE TOLD OUR LOVERS LORD AENEAS
IF NONE OF THEM HAVE SOUL IN SUCH A KIND
WE LEFT THEM ALL AT HOME BUT WE ARE SOLDIERS
AND MAY THAT SOLDIER A MERE RECREANT PROVE
THAT MEANS NOT HATH NOT OR IS NOT IN LOVE 
IF THEN ONE IS OR HATH OR MEANS TO BE
THAT ONE MEETS HECTOR IF NONE ELSE I AM HE 
TELL HIM OF NESTOR ONE THAT WAS A MAN
WHEN HECTORS GRANDSIRE SUCKD HE IS OLD NOW
BUT IF THERE BE NOT IN OUR GRECIAN HOST
ONE NOBLE MAN THAT HATH ONE SPARK OF FIRE
TO ANSWER FOR HIS LOVE TELL HIM FROM ME
ILL HIDE MY SILVER BEARD IN A GOLD BEAVER
AND IN MY VANTBRACE PUT THIS WITHERD BRAWN
AND MEETING HIM WILL TELL HIM THAT MY LADY
WAS FAIRER THAN HIS GRANDAM AND AS CHASTE
AS MAY BE IN THE WORLD HIS YOUTH IN FLOOD
ILL PROVE THIS TRUTH WITH MY THREE DROPS OF BLOOD 
NOW HEAVENS FORBID SUCH SCARCITY OF YOUTH 
AMEN 
FAIR LORD AENEAS LET ME TOUCH YOUR HAND
TO OUR PAVILION SHALL I LEAD YOU SIR 
ACHILLES SHALL HAVE WORD OF THIS INTENT
SO SHALL EACH LORD OF GREECE FROM TENT TO TENT
YOURSELF SHALL FEAST WITH US BEFORE YOU GO
AND FIND THE WELCOME OF A NOBLE FOE 
NESTOR 
WHAT SAYS ULYSSES
I HAVE A YOUNG CONCEPTION IN MY BRAIN
BE YOU MY TIME TO BRING IT TO SOME SHAPE 
WHAT IST
THIS TIS
BLUNT WEDGES RIVE HARD KNOTS THE SEEDED PRIDE
THAT HATH TO THIS MATURITY BLOWN UP
IN RANK ACHILLES MUST OR NOW BE CROPPD
OR SHEDDING BREED A NURSERY OF LIKE EVIL
TO OVERBULK US ALL 
WELL AND HOW
THIS CHALLENGE THAT THE GALLANT HECTOR SENDS
HOWEVER IT IS SPREAD IN GENERAL NAME
RELATES IN PURPOSE ONLY TO ACHILLES 
THE PURPOSE IS PERSPICUOUS EVEN AS SUBSTANCE
WHOSE GROSSNESS LITTLE CHARACTERS SUM UP
AND IN THE PUBLICATION MAKE NO STRAIN
BUT THAT ACHILLES WERE HIS BRAIN AS BARREN
AS BANKS OF LIBYA THOUGH APOLLO KNOWS
TIS DRY ENOUGH WILL WITH GREAT SPEED OF JUDGMENT
AY WITH CELERITY FIND HECTORS PURPOSE
POINTING ON HIM 
AND WAKE HIM TO THE ANSWER THINK YOU
YES TIS MOST MEET WHOM MAY YOU ELSE OPPOSE
THAT CAN FROM HECTOR BRING HIS HONOUR OFF
IF NOT ACHILLES THOUGHT BE A SPORTFUL COMBAT
YET IN THE TRIAL MUCH OPINION DWELLS
FOR HERE THE TROJANS TASTE OUR DEARST REPUTE
WITH THEIR FINEST PALATE AND TRUST TO ME ULYSSES
OUR IMPUTATION SHALL BE ODDLY POISED
IN THIS WILD ACTION FOR THE SUCCESS
ALTHOUGH PARTICULAR SHALL GIVE A SCANTLING
OF GOOD OR BAD UNTO THE GENERAL
AND IN SUCH INDEXES ALTHOUGH SMALL PRICKS
TO THEIR SUBSEQUENT VOLUMES THERE IS SEEN
THE BABY FIGURE OF THE GIANT MASS
OF THINGS TO COME AT LARGE  IT IS SUPPOSED
HE THAT MEETS HECTOR ISSUES FROM OUR CHOICE
AND CHOICE BEING MUTUAL ACT OF ALL OUR SOULS
MAKES MERIT HER ELECTION AND DOTH BOIL
AS TWERE FROM US ALL A MAN DISTILLD
OUT OF OUR VIRTUES WHO MISCARRYING
WHAT HEART RECEIVES FROM HENCE THE CONQUERING PART
TO STEEL A STRONG OPINION TO THEMSELVES
WHICH ENTERTAIND LIMBS ARE HIS INSTRUMENTS
IN NO LESS WORKING THAN ARE SWORDS AND BOWS
DIRECTIVE BY THE LIMBS 
GIVE PARDON TO MY SPEECH
THEREFORE TIS MEET ACHILLES MEET NOT HECTOR 
LET US LIKE MERCHANTS SHOW OUR FOULEST WARES
AND THINK PERCHANCE THEYLL SELL IF NOT
THE LUSTRE OF THE BETTER YET TO SHOW
SHALL SHOW THE BETTER  DO NOT CONSENT
THAT EVER HECTOR AND ACHILLES MEET
FOR BOTH OUR HONOUR AND OUR SHAME IN THIS
ARE DOGGD WITH TWO STRANGE FOLLOWERS 
I SEE THEM NOT WITH MY OLD EYES WHAT ARE THEY
WHAT GLORY OUR ACHILLES SHARES FROM HECTOR
WERE HE NOT PROUD WE ALL SHOULD SHARE WITH HIM
BUT HE ALREADY IS TOO INSOLENT
AND WE WERE BETTER PARCH IN AFRIC SUN
THAN IN THE PRIDE AND SALT SCORN OF HIS EYES
SHOULD HE SCAPE HECTOR FAIR IF HE WERE FOILD
WHY THEN WE DID OUR MAIN OPINION CRUSH
IN TAINT OF OUR BEST MAN  NO MAKE A LOTTERY
AND BY DEVICE LET BLOCKISH AJAX DRAW
THE SORT TO FIGHT WITH HECTOR AMONG OURSELVES
GIVE HIM ALLOWANCE FOR THE BETTER MAN
FOR THAT WILL PHYSIC THE GREAT MYRMIDON
WHO BROILS IN LOUD APPLAUSE AND MAKE HIM FALL
HIS CREST THAT PROUDER THAN BLUE IRIS BENDS 
IF THE DULL BRAINLESS AJAX COME SAFE OFF
WELL DRESS HIM UP IN VOICES IF HE FAIL
YET GO WE UNDER OUR OPINION STILL
THAT WE HAVE BETTER MEN  BUT HIT OR MISS
OUR PROJECTS LIFE THIS SHAPE OF SENSE ASSUMES
AJAX EMPLOYD PLUCKS DOWN ACHILLES PLUMES

IN HOT DIGESTION OF THIS CORMORANT WAR 
SHALL BE STRUCK OFF  HECTOR WHAT SAY YOU TOT
THOUGH NO MAN LESSER FEARS THE GREEKS THAN I
AS FAR AS TOUCHETH MY PARTICULAR
YET DREAD PRIAM
THERE IS NO LADY OF MORE SOFTER BOWELS
MORE SPONGY TO SUCK IN THE SENSE OF FEAR
MORE READY TO CRY OUT WHO KNOWS WHAT FOLLOWS
THAN HECTOR IS THE WOUND OF PEACE IS SURETY
SURETY SECURE BUT MODEST DOUBT IS CALLD
THE BEACON OF THE WISE THE TENT THAT SEARCHES
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WORST  LET HELEN GO
SINCE THE FIRST SWORD WAS DRAWN ABOUT THIS QUESTION
EVERY TITHE SOUL MONGST MANY THOUSAND DISMES
HATH BEEN AS DEAR AS HELEN I MEAN OF OURS
IF WE HAVE LOST SO MANY TENTHS OF OURS
TO GUARD A THING NOT OURS NOR WORTH TO US
HAD IT OUR NAME THE VALUE OF ONE TEN
WHAT MERITS IN THAT REASON WHICH DENIES
THE YIELDING OF HER UP
FIE FIE MY BROTHER 
WEIGH YOU THE WORTH AND HONOUR OF A KING
SO GREAT AS OUR DREAD FATHER IN A SCALE
OF COMMON OUNCES WILL YOU WITH COUNTERS SUM
THE PAST PROPORTION OF HIS INFINITE
AND BUCKLE IN A WAIST MOST FATHOMLESS
WITH SPANS AND INCHES SO DIMINUTIVE
AS FEARS AND REASONS FIE FOR GODLY SHAME 
NO MARVEL THOUGH YOU BITE SO SHARP AT REASONS
YOU ARE SO EMPTY OF THEM  SHOULD NOT OUR FATHER
BEAR THE GREAT SWAY OF HIS AFFAIRS WITH REASONS
BECAUSE YOUR SPEECH HATH NONE THAT TELLS HIM SO
YOU ARE FOR DREAMS AND SLUMBERS BROTHER PRIEST
YOU FUR YOUR GLOVES WITH REASON  HERE ARE
YOUR REASONS
YOU KNOW AN ENEMY INTENDS YOU HARM
YOU KNOW A SWORD EMPLOYD IS PERILOUS
AND REASON FLIES THE OBJECT OF ALL HARM
WHO MARVELS THEN WHEN HELENUS BEHOLDS
A GRECIAN AND HIS SWORD IF HE DO SET
THE VERY WINGS OF REASON TO HIS HEELS
AND FLY LIKE CHIDDEN MERCURY FROM JOVE
OR LIKE A STAR DISORBD NAY IF WE TALK OF REASON
LETS SHUT OUR GATES AND SLEEP MANHOOD AND HONOUR
SHOULD HAVE HAREHEARTS WOULD THEY BUT FAT
THEIR THOUGHTS
WITH THIS CRAMMD REASON REASON AND RESPECT
MAKE LIVERS PALE AND LUSTIHOOD DEJECT 
BROTHER SHE IS NOT WORTH WHAT SHE DOTH COST
THE HOLDING 
WHAT IS AUGHT BUT AS TIS VALUED
BUT VALUE DWELLS NOT IN PARTICULAR WILL
IT HOLDS HIS ESTIMATE AND DIGNITY
AS WELL WHEREIN TIS PRECIOUS OF ITSELF
AS IN THE PRIZER TIS MAD IDOLATRY
TO MAKE THE SERVICE GREATER THAN THE GOD
AND THE WILL DOTES THAT IS ATTRIBUTIVE
TO WHAT INFECTIOUSLY ITSELF AFFECTS
WITHOUT SOME IMAGE OF THE AFFECTED MERIT 
I TAKE TODAY A WIFE AND MY ELECTION
IS LED ON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY WILL
MY WILL ENKINDLED BY MINE EYES AND EARS
TWO TRADED PILOTS TWIXT THE DANGEROUS SHORES
OF WILL AND JUDGMENT HOW MAY I AVOID
ALTHOUGH MY WILL DISTASTE WHAT IT ELECTED
THE WIFE I CHOSE THERE CAN BE NO EVASION
TO BLENCH FROM THIS AND TO STAND FIRM BY HONOUR
WE TURN NOT BACK THE SILKS UPON THE MERCHANT
WHEN WE HAVE SOILD THEM NOR THE REMAINDER VIANDS
WE DO NOT THROW IN UNRESPECTIVE SIEVE
BECAUSE WE NOW ARE FULL  IT WAS THOUGHT MEET
PARIS SHOULD DO SOME VENGEANCE ON THE GREEKS
YOUR BREATH OF FULL CONSENT BELLIED HIS SAILS
THE SEAS AND WINDS OLD WRANGLERS TOOK A TRUCE
AND DID HIM SERVICE HE TOUCHD THE PORTS DESIRED
AND FOR AN OLD AUNT WHOM THE GREEKS HELD CAPTIVE
HE BROUGHT A GRECIAN QUEEN WHOSE YOUTH AND FRESHNESS
WRINKLES APOLLOS AND MAKES STALE THE MORNING 
WHY KEEP WE HER THE GRECIANS KEEP OUR AUNT
IS SHE WORTH KEEPING WHY SHE IS A PEARL
WHOSE PRICE HATH LAUNCHD ABOVE A THOUSAND SHIPS
AND TURND CROWND KINGS TO MERCHANTS 
IF YOULL AVOUCH TWAS WISDOM PARIS WENT 
AS YOU MUST NEEDS FOR YOU ALL CRIED GO GO 
IF YOULL CONFESS HE BROUGHT HOME NOBLE PRIZE 
AS YOU MUST NEEDS FOR YOU ALL CLAPPD YOUR HANDS
AND CRIED INESTIMABLE  WHY DO YOU NOW
THE ISSUE OF YOUR PROPER WISDOMS RATE
AND DO A DEED THAT FORTUNE NEVER DID
BEGGAR THE ESTIMATION WHICH YOU PRIZED
RICHER THAN SEA AND LAND O THEFT MOST BASE
THAT WE HAVE STOLN WHAT WE DO FEAR TO KEEP 
BUT THIEVES UNWORTHY OF A THING SO STOLN
THAT IN THEIR COUNTRY DID THEM THAT DISGRACE
WE FEAR TO WARRANT IN OUR NATIVE PLACE 
  CRY TROJANS CRY 
WHAT NOISE WHAT SHRIEK IS THIS
TIS OUR MAD SISTER I DO KNOW HER VOICE 
  CRY TROJANS 
IT IS CASSANDRA 
CRY TROJANS CRY  LEND ME TEN THOUSAND EYES
AND I WILL FILL THEM WITH PROPHETIC TEARS 
PEACE SISTER PEACE 
VIRGINS AND BOYS MIDAGE AND WRINKLED ELD
SOFT INFANCY THAT NOTHING CANST BUT CRY
ADD TO MY CLAMOURS  LET US PAY BETIMES
A MOIETY OF THAT MASS OF MOAN TO COME 
CRY TROJANS CRY  PRACTISE YOUR EYES WITH TEARS 
TROY MUST NOT BE NOR GOODLY ILION STAND
OUR FIREBRAND BROTHER PARIS BURNS US ALL 
CRY TROJANS CRY  A HELEN AND A WOE
CRY CRY  TROY BURNS OR ELSE LET HELEN GO 
NOW YOUTHFUL TROILUS DO NOT THESE HIGH STRAINS
OF DIVINATION IN OUR SISTER WORK
SOME TOUCHES OF REMORSE OR IS YOUR BLOOD
SO MADLY HOT THAT NO DISCOURSE OF REASON
NOR FEAR OF BAD SUCCESS IN A BAD CAUSE
CAN QUALIFY THE SAME
WHY BROTHER HECTOR
WE MAY NOT THINK THE JUSTNESS OF EACH ACT
SUCH AND NO OTHER THAN EVENT DOTH FORM IT
NOR ONCE DEJECT THE COURAGE OF OUR MINDS
BECAUSE CASSANDRAS MAD HER BRAINSICK RAPTURES
CANNOT DISTASTE THE GOODNESS OF A QUARREL
WHICH HATH OUR SEVERAL HONOURS ALL ENGAGED
TO MAKE IT GRACIOUS  FOR MY PRIVATE PART
I AM NO MORE TOUCHD THAN ALL PRIAMS SONS
AND JOVE FORBID THERE SHOULD BE DONE AMONGST US
SUCH THINGS AS MIGHT OFFEND THE WEAKEST SPLEEN
TO FIGHT FOR AND MAINTAIN 
ELSE MIGHT THE WORLD CONVINCE OF LEVITY
AS WELL MY UNDERTAKINGS AS YOUR COUNSELS
BUT I ATTEST THE GODS YOUR FULL CONSENT
GAVE WINGS TO MY PROPENSION AND CUT OFF
ALL FEARS ATTENDING ON SO DIRE A PROJECT 
FOR WHAT ALAS CAN THESE MY SINGLE ARMS
WHAT PROPUGNATION IS IN ONE MANS VALOUR
TO STAND THE PUSH AND ENMITY OF THOSE
THIS QUARREL WOULD EXCITE YET I PROTEST
WERE I ALONE TO PASS THE DIFFICULTIES
AND HAD AS AMPLE POWER AS I HAVE WILL
PARIS SHOULD NEER RETRACT WHAT HE HATH DONE
NOR FAINT IN THE PURSUIT 
PARIS YOU SPEAK
LIKE ONE BESOTTED ON YOUR SWEET DELIGHTS
YOU HAVE THE HONEY STILL BUT THESE THE GALL
SO TO BE VALIANT IS NO PRAISE AT ALL 
SIR I PROPOSE NOT MERELY TO MYSELF
THE PLEASURES SUCH A BEAUTY BRINGS WITH IT
BUT I WOULD HAVE THE SOIL OF HER FAIR RAPE
WIPED OFF IN HONOURABLE KEEPING HER 
WHAT TREASON WERE IT TO THE RANSACKD QUEEN
DISGRACE TO YOUR GREAT WORTHS AND SHAME TO ME
NOW TO DELIVER HER POSSESSION UP
ON TERMS OF BASE COMPULSION  CAN IT BE
THAT SO DEGENERATE A STRAIN AS THIS
SHOULD ONCE SET FOOTING IN YOUR GENEROUS BOSOMS
THERES NOT THE MEANEST SPIRIT ON OUR PARTY
WITHOUT A HEART TO DARE OR SWORD TO DRAW
WHEN HELEN IS DEFENDED NOR NONE SO NOBLE
WHOSE LIFE WERE ILL BESTOWD OR DEATH UNFAMED
WHERE HELEN IS THE SUBJECT THEN I SAY
WELL MAY WE FIGHT FOR HER WHOM WE KNOW WELL
THE WORLDS LARGE SPACES CANNOT PARALLEL 
PARIS AND TROILUS YOU HAVE BOTH SAID WELL
AND ON THE CAUSE AND QUESTION NOW IN HAND
HAVE GLOZED BUT SUPERFICIALLY NOT MUCH
UNLIKE YOUNG MEN WHOM ARISTOTLE THOUGHT
UNFIT TO HEAR MORAL PHILOSOPHY
THE REASONS YOU ALLEGE DO MORE CONDUCE
TO THE HOT PASSION OF DISTEMPERD BLOOD
THAN TO MAKE UP A FREE DETERMINATION
TWIXT RIGHT AND WRONG FOR PLEASURE AND REVENGE
HAVE EARS MORE DEAF THAN ADDERS TO THE VOICE
OF ANY TRUE DECISION  NATURE CRAVES
ALL DUES BE RENDERD TO THEIR OWNERS NOW
WHAT NEARER DEBT IN ALL HUMANITY
THAN WIFE IS TO THE HUSBAND IF THIS LAW
OF NATURE BE CORRUPTED THROUGH AFFECTION
AND THAT GREAT MINDS OF PARTIAL INDULGENCE
TO THEIR BENUMBED WILLS RESIST THE SAME
THERE IS A LAW IN EACH WELLORDERD NATION
TO CURB THOSE RAGING APPETITES THAT ARE
MOST DISOBEDIENT AND REFRACTORY 
IF HELEN THEN BE WIFE TO SPARTAS KING
AS IT IS KNOWN SHE IS THESE MORAL LAWS
OF NATURE AND OF NATIONS SPEAK ALOUD
TO HAVE HER BACK RETURND THUS TO PERSIST
IN DOING WRONG EXTENUATES NOT WRONG
BUT MAKES IT MUCH MORE HEAVY  HECTORS OPINION
IS THIS IN WAY OF TRUTH YET NEERTHELESS
MY SPRITELY BRETHREN I PROPEND TO YOU
IN RESOLUTION TO KEEP HELEN STILL
FOR TIS A CAUSE THAT HATH NO MEAN DEPENDANCE
UPON OUR JOINT AND SEVERAL DIGNITIES 
WHY THERE YOU TOUCHD THE LIFE OF OUR DESIGN
WERE IT NOT GLORY THAT WE MORE AFFECTED
THAN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR HEAVING SPLEENS
I WOULD NOT WISH A DROP OF TROJAN BLOOD
SPENT MORE IN HER DEFENCE  BUT WORTHY HECTOR
SHE IS A THEME OF HONOUR AND RENOWN
A SPUR TO VALIANT AND MAGNANIMOUS DEEDS
WHOSE PRESENT COURAGE MAY BEAT DOWN OUR FOES
AND FAME IN TIME TO COME CANONIZE US
FOR I PRESUME BRAVE HECTOR WOULD NOT LOSE
SO RICH ADVANTAGE OF A PROMISED GLORY
AS SMILES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THIS ACTION
FOR THE WIDE WORLDS REVENUE 
I AM YOURS
YOU VALIANT OFFSPRING OF GREAT PRIAMUS 
I HAVE A ROISTING CHALLENGE SENT AMONGST
THE DUN AND FACTIOUS NOBLES OF THE GREEKS
WILL STRIKE AMAZEMENT TO THEIR DROWSY SPIRITS
I WAS ADVERTISED THEIR GREAT GENERAL SLEPT
WHILST EMULATION IN THE ARMY CREPT
THIS I PRESUME WILL WAKE HIM 
HOW NOW THERSITES  WHAT LOST IN THE LABYRINTH OF
THY FURY  SHALL THE ELEPHANT AJAX CARRY IT THUS HE
BEATS ME AND I RAIL AT HIM O WORTHY SATISFACTION 
WOULD IT WERE OTHERWISE THAT I COULD BEAT HIM
WHILST HE RAILED AT ME  SFOOT ILL LEARN TO
CONJURE AND RAISE DEVILS BUT ILL SEE SOME ISSUE OF
MY SPITEFUL EXECRATIONS  THEN THERES ACHILLES A
RARE ENGINER  IF TROY BE NOT TAKEN TILL THESE TWO
UNDERMINE IT THE WALLS WILL STAND TILL THEY FALL OF
THEMSELVES  O THOU GREAT THUNDERDARTER OF OLYMPUS
FORGET THAT THOU ART JOVE THE KING OF GODS AND
MERCURY LOSE ALL THE SERPENTINE CRAFT OF THY
CADUCEUS IF YE TAKE NOT THAT LITTLE LITTLE LESS
THAN LITTLE WIT FROM THEM THAT THEY HAVE  WHICH
SHORTARMED IGNORANCE ITSELF KNOWS IS SO ABUNDANT
SCARCE IT WILL NOT IN CIRCUMVENTION DELIVER A FLY
FROM A SPIDER WITHOUT DRAWING THEIR MASSY IRONS AND
CUTTING THE WEB  AFTER THIS THE VENGEANCE ON THE
WHOLE CAMP  OR RATHER THE BONEACHE  FOR THAT
METHINKS IS THE CURSE DEPENDENT ON THOSE THAT WAR
FOR A PLACKET  I HAVE SAID MY PRAYERS AND DEVIL ENVY
SAY AMEN  WHAT HO  MY LORD ACHILLES 
WHOS THERE THERSITES  GOOD THERSITES COME IN AND RAIL 
IF I COULD HAVE REMEMBERED A GILT COUNTERFEIT THOU

CURSE OF MANKIND FOLLY AND IGNORANCE BE THINE IN
GREAT REVENUE  HEAVEN BLESS THEE FROM A TUTOR AND
DISCIPLINE COME NOT NEAR THEE  LET THY BLOOD BE THY

ENOUGH THAN FOR US TO UNDERGO ANY DIFFICULTY IMPOSED 
THIS IS THE MONSTRUOSITY IN LOVE LADY THAT THE WILL
IS INFINITE AND THE EXECUTION CONFINED THAT THE
DESIRE IS BOUNDLESS AND THE ACT A SLAVE TO LIMIT 
THEY SAY ALL LOVERS SWEAR MORE PERFORMANCE THAN THEY
ARE ABLE AND YET RESERVE AN ABILITY THAT THEY NEVER

EXCEEDS MANS MIGHT THAT DWELLS WITH GODS ABOVE 
O THAT I THOUGHT IT COULD BE IN A WOMAN 
AS IF IT CAN I WILL PRESUME IN YOU 
TO FEED FOR AYE HER RAMP AND FLAMES OF LOVE
TO KEEP HER CONSTANCY IN PLIGHT AND YOUTH
OUTLIVING BEAUTYS OUTWARD WITH A MIND
THAT DOTH RENEW SWIFTER THAN BLOOD DECAYS 
OR THAT PERSUASION COULD BUT THUS CONVINCE ME
THAT MY INTEGRITY AND TRUTH TO YOU
MIGHT BE AFFRONTED WITH THE MATCH AND WEIGHT
OF SUCH A WINNOWD PURITY IN LOVE
HOW WERE I THEN UPLIFTED  BUT ALAS 
I AM AS TRUE AS TRUTHS SIMPLICITY
AND SIMPLER THAN THE INFANCY OF TRUTH 
IN THAT ILL WAR WITH YOU 
O VIRTUOUS FIGHT
WHEN RIGHT WITH RIGHT WARS WHO SHALL BE MOST RIGHT 
TRUE SWAINS IN LOVE SHALL IN THE WORLD TO COME
APPROVE THEIR TRUTHS BY TROILUS WHEN THEIR RHYMES
FULL OF PROTEST OF OATH AND BIG COMPARE
WANT SIMILES TRUTH TIRED WITH ITERATION
AS TRUE AS STEEL AS PLANTAGE TO THE MOON

AS TRUE AS TROILUS SHALL CROWN UP THE VERSE
AND SANCTIFY THE NUMBERS 
PROPHET MAY YOU BE 
IF I BE FALSE OR SWERVE A HAIR FROM TRUTH

TO COME AS HUMBLY AS THEY USED TO CREEP
TO HOLY ALTARS 
WHAT AM I POOR OF LATE
TIS CERTAIN GREATNESS ONCE FALLN OUT WITH FORTUNE
MUST FALL OUT WITH MEN TOO WHAT THE DECLINED IS
HE SHALL AS SOON READ IN THE EYES OF OTHERS
AS FEEL IN HIS OWN FALL FOR MEN LIKE BUTTERFLIES
SHOW NOT THEIR MEALY WINGS BUT TO THE SUMMER
AND NOT A MAN FOR BEING SIMPLY MAN
HATH ANY HONOUR BUT HONOUR FOR THOSE HONOURS
THAT ARE WITHOUT HIM AS PLACE RICHES FAVOUR
PRIZES OF ACCIDENT AS OFT AS MERIT
WHICH WHEN THEY FALL AS BEING SLIPPERY STANDERS
THE LOVE THAT LEAND ON THEM AS SLIPPERY TOO
DO ONE PLUCK DOWN ANOTHER AND TOGETHER
DIE IN THE FALL  BUT TIS NOT SO WITH ME
FORTUNE AND I ARE FRIENDS I DO ENJOY
AT AMPLE POINT ALL THAT I DID POSSESS
SAVE THESE MENS LOOKS WHO DO METHINKS FIND OUT
SOMETHING NOT WORTH IN ME SUCH RICH BEHOLDING
AS THEY HAVE OFTEN GIVEN  HERE IS ULYSSES
ILL INTERRUPT HIS READING 
HOW NOW ULYSSES 
NOW GREAT THETIS SON 
WHAT ARE YOU READING
A STRANGE FELLOW HERE
WRITES ME THAT MAN HOW DEARLY EVER PARTED
HOW MUCH IN HAVING OR WITHOUT OR IN
CANNOT MAKE BOAST TO HAVE THAT WHICH HE HATH
NOR FEELS NOT WHAT HE OWES BUT BY REFLECTION
AS WHEN HIS VIRTUES SHINING UPON OTHERS
HEAT THEM AND THEY RETORT THAT HEAT AGAIN
TO THE FIRST GIVER 
THIS IS NOT STRANGE ULYSSES 
THE BEAUTY THAT IS BORNE HERE IN THE FACE
THE BEARER KNOWS NOT BUT COMMENDS ITSELF
TO OTHERS EYES NOR DOTH THE EYE ITSELF
THAT MOST PURE SPIRIT OF SENSE BEHOLD ITSELF
NOT GOING FROM ITSELF BUT EYE TO EYE OPPOSED
SALUTES EACH OTHER WITH EACH OTHERS FORM
FOR SPECULATION TURNS NOT TO ITSELF
TILL IT HATH TRAVELLD AND IS MIRRORD THERE
WHERE IT MAY SEE ITSELF  THIS IS NOT STRANGE AT ALL 
I DO NOT STRAIN AT THE POSITION 
IT IS FAMILIAR BUT AT THE AUTHORS DRIFT
WHO IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCE EXPRESSLY PROVES
THAT NO MAN IS THE LORD OF ANY THING
THOUGH IN AND OF HIM THERE BE MUCH CONSISTING
TILL HE COMMUNICATE HIS PARTS TO OTHERS
NOR DOTH HE OF HIMSELF KNOW THEM FOR AUGHT
TILL HE BEHOLD THEM FORMD IN THE APPLAUSE
WHERE THEYRE EXTENDED WHO LIKE AN ARCH
REVERBERATES
THE VOICE AGAIN OR LIKE A GATE OF STEEL
FRONTING THE SUN RECEIVES AND RENDERS BACK
HIS FIGURE AND HIS HEAT   I WAS MUCH WRAPT IN THIS
AND APPREHENDED HERE IMMEDIATELY
THE UNKNOWN AJAX 
HEAVENS WHAT A MAN IS THERE  A VERY HORSE
THAT HAS HE KNOWS NOT WHAT  NATURE WHAT THINGS THERE ARE
MOST ABJECT IN REGARD AND DEAR IN USE 
WHAT THINGS AGAIN MOST DEAR IN THE ESTEEM
AND POOR IN WORTH  NOW SHALL WE SEE TOMORROW 
AN ACT THAT VERY CHANCE DOTH THROW UPON HIM 
AJAX RENOWND  O HEAVENS WHAT SOME MEN DO
WHILE SOME MEN LEAVE TO DO 
HOW SOME MEN CREEP IN SKITTISH FORTUNES HALL
WHILES OTHERS PLAY THE IDIOTS IN HER EYES 
HOW ONE MAN EATS INTO ANOTHERS PRIDE
WHILE PRIDE IS FASTING IN HIS WANTONNESS 
TO SEE THESE GRECIAN LORDS  WHY EVEN ALREADY
THEY CLAP THE LUBBER AJAX ON THE SHOULDER
AS IF HIS FOOT WERE ON BRAVE HECTORS BREAST
AND GREAT TROY SHRIEKING 
I DO BELIEVE IT FOR THEY PASSD BY ME
AS MISERS DO BY BEGGARS NEITHER GAVE TO ME
GOOD WORD NOR LOOK WHAT ARE MY DEEDS FORGOT
TIME HATH MY LORD A WALLET AT HIS BACK
WHEREIN HE PUTS ALMS FOR OBLIVION
A GREATSIZED MONSTER OF INGRATITUDES
THOSE SCRAPS ARE GOOD DEEDS PAST WHICH ARE DEVOURD
AS FAST AS THEY ARE MADE FORGOT AS SOON
AS DONE PERSEVERANCE DEAR MY LORD
KEEPS HONOUR BRIGHT TO HAVE DONE IS TO HANG
QUITE OUT OF FASHION LIKE A RUSTY MAIL
IN MONUMENTAL MOCKERY  TAKE THE INSTANT WAY
FOR HONOUR TRAVELS IN A STRAIT SO NARROW
WHERE ONE BUT GOES ABREAST KEEP THEN THE PATH
FOR EMULATION HATH A THOUSAND SONS
THAT ONE BY ONE PURSUE IF YOU GIVE WAY
OR HEDGE ASIDE FROM THE DIRECT FORTHRIGHT
LIKE TO AN ENTERD TIDE THEY ALL RUSH BY
AND LEAVE YOU HINDMOST
OR LIKE A GALLANT HORSE FALLN IN FIRST RANK
LIE THERE FOR PAVEMENT TO THE ABJECT REAR
OERRUN AND TRAMPLED ON THEN WHAT THEY DO IN PRESENT
THOUGH LESS THAN YOURS IN PAST MUST OERTOP YOURS
FOR TIME IS LIKE A FASHIONABLE HOST
THAT SLIGHTLY SHAKES HIS PARTING GUEST BY THE HAND
AND WITH HIS ARMS OUTSTRETCHD AS HE WOULD FLY
GRASPS IN THE COMER WELCOME EVER SMILES
AND FAREWELL GOES OUT SIGHING  O LET NOT
VIRTUE SEEK
REMUNERATION FOR THE THING IT WAS
FOR BEAUTY WIT
HIGH BIRTH VIGOUR OF BONE DESERT IN SERVICE
LOVE FRIENDSHIP CHARITY ARE SUBJECTS ALL
TO ENVIOUS AND CALUMNIATING TIME 
ONE TOUCH OF NATURE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN
THAT ALL WITH ONE CONSENT PRAISE NEWBORN GAWDS
THOUGH THEY ARE MADE AND MOULDED OF THINGS PAST
AND GIVE TO DUST THAT IS A LITTLE GILT
MORE LAUD THAN GILT OERDUSTED 
THE PRESENT EYE PRAISES THE PRESENT OBJECT 
THEN MARVEL NOT THOU GREAT AND COMPLETE MAN
THAT ALL THE GREEKS BEGIN TO WORSHIP AJAX
SINCE THINGS IN MOTION SOONER CATCH THE EYE
THAN WHAT NOT STIRS  THE CRY WENT ONCE ON THEE
AND STILL IT MIGHT AND YET IT MAY AGAIN
IF THOU WOULDST NOT ENTOMB THYSELF ALIVE
AND CASE THY REPUTATION IN THY TENT
WHOSE GLORIOUS DEEDS BUT IN THESE FIELDS OF LATE
MADE EMULOUS MISSIONS MONGST THE GODS THEMSELVES
AND DRAVE GREAT MARS TO FACTION 
OF THIS MY PRIVACY
I HAVE STRONG REASONS 
BUT GAINST YOUR PRIVACY
THE REASONS ARE MORE POTENT AND HEROICAL
TIS KNOWN ACHILLES THAT YOU ARE IN LOVE
WITH ONE OF PRIAMS DAUGHTERS 
HA  KNOWN 
IS THAT A WONDER
THE PROVIDENCE THATS IN A WATCHFUL STATE
KNOWS ALMOST EVERY GRAIN OF PLUTUS GOLD
FINDS BOTTOM IN THE UNCOMPREHENSIVE DEEPS
KEEPS PLACE WITH THOUGHT AND ALMOST LIKE THE GODS
DOES THOUGHTS UNVEIL IN THEIR DUMB CRADLES 
THERE IS A MYSTERY WITH WHOM RELATION
DURST NEVER MEDDLE IN THE SOUL OF STATE
WHICH HATH AN OPERATION MORE DIVINE
THAN BREATH OR PEN CAN GIVE EXPRESSURE TO
ALL THE COMMERCE THAT YOU HAVE HAD WITH TROY
AS PERFECTLY IS OURS AS YOURS MY LORD
AND BETTER WOULD IT FIT ACHILLES MUCH
TO THROW DOWN HECTOR THAN POLYXENA
BUT IT MUST GRIEVE YOUNG PYRRHUS NOW AT HOME
WHEN FAME SHALL IN OUR ISLANDS SOUND HER TRUMP
AND ALL THE GREEKISH GIRLS SHALL TRIPPING SING
GREAT HECTORS SISTER DID ACHILLES WIN
BUT OUR GREAT AJAX BRAVELY BEAT DOWN HIM 
FAREWELL MY LORD I AS YOUR LOVER SPEAK
THE FOOL SLIDES OER THE ICE THAT YOU SHOULD BREAK 
TO THIS EFFECT ACHILLES HAVE I MOVED YOU

IN TIME OF ACTION  I STAND CONDEMND FOR THIS
THEY THINK MY LITTLE STOMACH TO THE WAR
AND YOUR GREAT LOVE TO ME RESTRAINS YOU THUS
SWEET ROUSE YOURSELF AND THE WEAK WANTON CUPID

OMISSION TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY

AND DANGER LIKE AN AGUE SUBTLY TAINTS
EVEN THEN WHEN WE SIT IDLY IN THE SUN 
GO CALL THERSITES HITHER SWEET PATROCLUS
ILL SEND THE FOOL TO AJAX AND DESIRE HIM
TO INVITE THE TROJAN LORDS AFTER THE COMBAT
TO SEE US HERE UNARMD I HAVE A WOMANS LONGING
AN APPETITE THAT I AM SICK WITHAL
TO SEE GREAT HECTOR IN HIS WEEDS OF PEACE
TO TALK WITH HIM AND TO BEHOLD HIS VISAGE
EVEN TO MY FULL OF VIEW 
A LABOUR SAVED 
A WONDER 
WHAT
AJAX GOES UP AND DOWN THE FIELD ASKING FOR HIMSELF 
HOW SO
HE MUST FIGHT SINGLY TOMORROW WITH HECTOR AND IS SO
PROPHETICALLY PROUD OF AN HEROICAL CUDGELLING THAT HE
RAVES IN SAYING NOTHING 
HOW CAN THAT BE
WHY HE STALKS UP AND DOWN LIKE A PEACOCK A STRIDE
AND A STAND RUMINATES LIKE AN HOSTESS THAT HATH NO
ARITHMETIC BUT HER BRAIN TO SET DOWN HER RECKONING
BITES HIS LIP WITH A POLITIC REGARD AS WHO SHOULD
SAY THERE WERE WIT IN THIS HEAD AN TWOULD OUT
AND SO THERE IS BUT IT LIES AS COLDLY IN HIM AS FIRE
IN A FLINT WHICH WILL NOT SHOW WITHOUT KNOCKING 
THE MANS UNDONE FOREVER FOR IF HECTOR BREAK NOT HIS
NECK I THE COMBAT HELL BREAK T HIMSELF IN
VAINGLORY  HE KNOWS NOT ME I SAID GOOD MORROW
AJAX AND HE REPLIES THANKS AGAMEMNON  WHAT THINK
