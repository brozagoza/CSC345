NOBLE PATRICIANS PATRONS OF MY RIGHT
DEFEND THE JUSTICE OF MY CAUSE WITH ARMS
AND COUNTRYMEN MY LOVING FOLLOWERS
PLEAD MY SUCCESSIVE TITLE WITH YOUR SWORDS
I AM HIS FIRSTBORN SON THAT WAS THE LAST
THAT WORE THE IMPERIAL DIADEM OF ROME
THEN LET MY FATHERS HONOURS LIVE IN ME
NOR WRONG MINE AGE WITH THIS INDIGNITY 
ROMANS FRIENDS FOLLOWERS FAVORERS OF MY RIGHT
IF EVER BASSIANUS CAESARS SON
WERE GRACIOUS IN THE EYES OF ROYAL ROME
KEEP THEN THIS PASSAGE TO THE CAPITOL
AND SUFFER NOT DISHONOUR TO APPROACH
THE IMPERIAL SEAT TO VIRTUE CONSECRATE
TO JUSTICE CONTINENCE AND NOBILITY
BUT LET DESERT IN PURE ELECTION SHINE
AND ROMANS FIGHT FOR FREEDOM IN YOUR CHOICE 
PRINCES THAT STRIVE BY FACTIONS AND BY FRIENDS
AMBITIOUSLY FOR RULE AND EMPERY
KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF ROME FOR WHOM WE STAND
A SPECIAL PARTY HAVE BY COMMON VOICE
IN ELECTION FOR THE ROMAN EMPERY
CHOSEN ANDRONICUS SURNAMED PIUS
FOR MANY GOOD AND GREAT DESERTS TO ROME
A NOBLER MAN A BRAVER WARRIOR
LIVES NOT THIS DAY WITHIN THE CITY WALLS
HE BY THE SENATE IS ACCITD HOME
FROM WEARY WARS AGAINST THE BARBAROUS GOTHS
THAT WITH HIS SONS A TERROR TO OUR FOES
HATH YOKED A NATION STRONG TRAIND UP IN ARMS 
TEN YEARS ARE SPENT SINCE FIRST HE UNDERTOOK
THIS CAUSE OF ROME AND CHASTISED WITH ARMS
OUR ENEMIES PRIDE FIVE TIMES HE HATH RETURND
BLEEDING TO ROME BEARING HIS VALIANT SONS
IN COFFINS FROM THE FIELD
AND NOW AT LAST LADEN WITH HORRORS SPOILS
RETURNS THE GOOD ANDRONICUS TO ROME
RENOWNED TITUS FLOURISHING IN ARMS 
LET US ENTREAT BY HONOUR OF HIS NAME
WHOM WORTHILY YOU WOULD HAVE NOW SUCCEED 
AND IN THE CAPITOL AND SENATES RIGHT
WHOM YOU PRETEND TO HONOUR AND ADORE
THAT YOU WITHDRAW YOU AND ABATE YOUR STRENGTH
DISMISS YOUR FOLLOWERS AND AS SUITORS SHOULD
PLEAD YOUR DESERTS IN PEACE AND HUMBLENESS 
HOW FAIR THE TRIBUNE SPEAKS TO CALM MY THOUGHTS 
MARCUS ANDRONICUS SO I DO ALLY
IN THY UPRIGHTNESS AND INTEGRITY
AND SO I LOVE AND HONOUR THEE AND THINE
THY NOBLE BROTHER TITUS AND HIS SONS
AND HER TO WHOM MY THOUGHTS ARE HUMBLED ALL
GRACIOUS LAVINIA ROMES RICH ORNAMENT
THAT I WILL HERE DISMISS MY LOVING FRIENDS
AND TO MY FORTUNES AND THE PEOPLES FAVOR
COMMIT MY CAUSE IN BALANCE TO BE WEIGHD 
FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN THUS FORWARD IN MY RIGHT
I THANK YOU ALL AND HERE DISMISS YOU ALL
AND TO THE LOVE AND FAVOR OF MY COUNTRY
COMMIT MYSELF MY PERSON AND THE CAUSE 
ROME BE AS JUST AND GRACIOUS UNTO ME
AS I AM CONFIDENT AND KIND TO THEE 
OPEN THE GATES AND LET ME IN 
TRIBUNES AND ME A POOR COMPETITOR 
ROMANS MAKE WAY THE GOOD ANDRONICUS 
PATRON OF VIRTUE ROMES BEST CHAMPION
SUCCESSFUL IN THE BATTLES THAT HE FIGHTS
WITH HONOUR AND WITH FORTUNE IS RETURND
FROM WHERE HE CIRCUMSCRIBED WITH HIS SWORD
AND BROUGHT TO YOKE THE ENEMIES OF ROME 
HAIL ROME VICTORIOUS IN THY MOURNING WEEDS 
LO AS THE BARK THAT HATH DISCHARGED HER FRAUGHT
RETURNS WITH PRECIOUS JADING TO THE BAY
FROM WHENCE AT FIRST SHE WEIGHD HER ANCHORAGE
COMETH ANDRONICUS BOUND WITH LAUREL BOUGHS
TO RESALUTE HIS COUNTRY WITH HIS TEARS
TEARS OF TRUE JOY FOR HIS RETURN TO ROME 
THOU GREAT DEFENDER OF THIS CAPITOL
STAND GRACIOUS TO THE RITES THAT WE INTEND 
ROMANS OF FIVE AND TWENTY VALIANT SONS
HALF OF THE NUMBER THAT KING PRIAM HAD
BEHOLD THE POOR REMAINS ALIVE AND DEAD 
THESE THAT SURVIVE LET ROME REWARD WITH LOVE
THESE THAT I BRING UNTO THEIR LATEST HOME
WITH BURIAL AMONGST THEIR ANCESTORS
HERE GOTHS HAVE GIVEN ME LEAVE TO SHEATHE MY SWORD 
TITUS UNKIND AND CARELESS OF THINE OWN
WHY SUFFERST THOU THY SONS UNBURIED YET
TO HOVER ON THE DREADFUL SHORE OF STYX
MAKE WAY TO LAY THEM BY THEIR BRETHREN 
THERE GREET IN SILENCE AS THE DEAD ARE WONT
AND SLEEP IN PEACE SLAIN IN YOUR COUNTRYS WARS 
O SACRED RECEPTACLE OF MY JOYS
SWEET CELL OF VIRTUE AND NOBILITY
HOW MANY SONS OF MINE HAST THOU IN STORE
THAT THOU WILT NEVER RENDER TO ME MORE 
GIVE US THE PROUDEST PRISONER OF THE GOTHS
THAT WE MAY HEW HIS LIMBS AND ON A PILE
AD MANES FRATRUM SACRIFICE HIS FLESH
BEFORE THIS EARTHY PRISON OF THEIR BONES
THAT SO THE SHADOWS BE NOT UNAPPEASED
NOR WE DISTURBD WITH PRODIGIES ON EARTH 
I GIVE HIM YOU THE NOBLEST THAT SURVIVES
THE ELDEST SON OF THIS DISTRESSED QUEEN 
STAY ROMAN BRETHREN  GRACIOUS CONQUEROR
VICTORIOUS TITUS RUE THE TEARS I SHED
A MOTHERS TEARS IN PASSION FOR HER SON
AND IF THY SONS WERE EVER DEAR TO THEE
O THINK MY SON TO BE AS DEAR TO ME 
SUFFICETH NOT THAT WE ARE BROUGHT TO ROME
TO BEAUTIFY THY TRIUMPHS AND RETURN
CAPTIVE TO THEE AND TO THY ROMAN YOKE
BUT MUST MY SONS BE SLAUGHTERD IN THE STREETS
FOR VALIANT DOINGS IN THEIR COUNTRYS CAUSE
O IF TO FIGHT FOR KING AND COMMONWEAL
WERE PIETY IN THINE IT IS IN THESE 
ANDRONICUS STAIN NOT THY TOMB WITH BLOOD
WILT THOU DRAW NEAR THE NATURE OF THE GODS
DRAW NEAR THEM THEN IN BEING MERCIFUL
SWEET MERCY IS NOBILITYS TRUE BADGE
THRICE NOBLE TITUS SPARE MY FIRSTBORN SON 
PATIENT YOURSELF MADAM AND PARDON ME 
THESE ARE THEIR BRETHREN WHOM YOU GOTHS BEHELD
ALIVE AND DEAD AND FOR THEIR BRETHREN SLAIN
RELIGIOUSLY THEY ASK A SACRIFICE

TO APPEASE THEIR GROANING SHADOWS THAT ARE GONE 
AWAY WITH HIM  AND MAKE A FIRE STRAIGHT
AND WITH OUR SWORDS UPON A PILE OF WOOD
LETS HEW HIS LIMBS TILL THEY BE CLEAN CONSUMED 
O CRUEL IRRELIGIOUS PIETY 
WAS EVER SCYTHIA HALF SO BARBAROUS
OPPOSE NOT SCYTHIA TO AMBITIOUS ROME 
ALARBUS GOES TO REST AND WE SURVIVE
TO TREMBLE UNDER TITUS THREATENING LOOKS 
THEN MADAM STAND RESOLVED BUT HOPE WITHAL
THE SELFSAME GODS THAT ARMD THE QUEEN OF TROY
WITH OPPORTUNITY OF SHARP REVENGE
UPON THE THRACIAN TYRANT IN HIS TENT
MAY FAVOR TAMORA THE QUEEN OF GOTHS 
WHEN GOTHS WERE GOTHS AND TAMORA WAS QUEEN 
TO QUIT THE BLOODY WRONGS UPON HER FOES 
SEE LORD AND FATHER HOW WE HAVE PERFORMD
OUR ROMAN RITES ALARBUS LIMBS ARE LOPPD
AND ENTRAILS FEED THE SACRIFICING FIRE
WHOSE SMOKE LIKE INCENSE DOTH PERFUME THE SKY 
REMAINETH NOUGHT BUT TO INTER OUR BRETHREN
AND WITH LOUD LARUMS WELCOME THEM TO ROME 
LET IT BE SO AND LET ANDRONICUS
MAKE THIS HIS LATEST FAREWELL TO THEIR SOULS

ADVANCED ABOVE PALE ENVYS THREATENING REACH 
AS WHEN THE GOLDEN SUN SALUTES THE MORN
AND HAVING GILT THE OCEAN WITH HIS BEAMS
GALLOPS THE ZODIAC IN HIS GLISTERING COACH
AND OVERLOOKS THE HIGHESTPEERING HILLS
SO TAMORA
UPON HER WIT DOTH EARTHLY HONOUR WAIT

AND MOUNT HER PITCH WHOM THOU IN TRIUMPH LONG

I AM AS ABLE AND AS FIT AS THOU
TO SERVE AND TO DESERVE MY MISTRESS GRACE
AND THAT MY SWORD UPON THEE SHALL APPROVE
AND PLEAD MY PASSIONS FOR LAVINIAS LOVE 
  CLUBS CLUBS  THESE LOVERS WILL NOT KEEP

WHY BOY ALTHOUGH OUR MOTHER UNADVISED

AY BOY GROW YE SO BRAVE
  WHY HOW NOW LORDS 
SO NEAR THE EMPERORS PALACE DARE YOU DRAW
AND MAINTAIN SUCH A QUARREL OPENLY
FULL WELL I WOT THE GROUND OF ALL THIS GRUDGE
I WOULD NOT FOR A MILLION OF GOLD
THE CAUSE WERE KNOWN TO THEM IT MOST CONCERNS
NOR WOULD YOUR NOBLE MOTHER FOR MUCH MORE
BE SO DISHONOURD IN THE COURT OF ROME 
FOR SHAME PUT UP 
NOT I TILL I HAVE SHEATHED
MY RAPIER IN HIS BOSOM AND WITHAL
THRUST THESE REPROACHFUL SPEECHES DOWN HIS THROAT
THAT HE HATH BREATHED IN MY DISHONOUR HERE 
FOR THAT I AM PREPARED AND FULL RESOLVED 
FOULSPOKEN COWARD THAT THUNDERST WITH THY TONGUE
AND WITH THY WEAPON NOTHING DAREST PERFORM 
AWAY I SAY 
NOW BY THE GODS THAT WARLIKE GOTHS ADORE
THIS PETTY BRABBLE WILL UNDO US ALL 
WHY LORDS AND THINK YOU NOT HOW DANGEROUS
IT IS TO JET UPON A PRINCES RIGHT
WHAT IS LAVINIA THEN BECOME SO LOOSE
OR BASSIANUS SO DEGENERATE
THAT FOR HER LOVE SUCH QUARRELS MAY BE BROACHD
WITHOUT CONTROLMENT JUSTICE OR REVENGE
YOUNG LORDS BEWARE  AND SHOULD THE EMPRESS KNOW
THIS DISCORDS GROUND THE MUSIC WOULD NOT PLEASE 
I CARE NOT I KNEW SHE AND ALL THE WORLD
I LOVE LAVINIA MORE THAN ALL THE WORLD 
YOUNGLING LEARN THOU TO MAKE SOME MEANER CHOICE
LAVINIA IS THINE ELDER BROTHERS HOPE 
WHY ARE YE MAD OR KNOW YE NOT IN ROME
HOW FURIOUS AND IMPATIENT THEY BE
AND CANNOT BROOK COMPETITORS IN LOVE
I TELL YOU LORDS YOU DO BUT PLOT YOUR DEATHS
BY THIS DEVICE 
AARON A THOUSAND DEATHS
WOULD I PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE HER WHOM I LOVE 
TO ACHIEVE HER  HOW
WHY MAKEST THOU IT SO STRANGE
SHE IS A WOMAN THEREFORE MAY BE WOOD
SHE IS A WOMAN THEREFORE MAY BE WON
SHE IS LAVINIA THEREFORE MUST BE LOVED 
WHAT MAN  MORE WATER GLIDETH BY THE MILL
THAN WOTS THE MILLER OF AND EASY IT IS
OF A CUT LOAF TO STEAL A SHIVE WE KNOW
THOUGH BASSIANUS BE THE EMPERORS BROTHER 
BETTER THAN HE HAVE WORN VULCANS BADGE 
  AY AND AS GOOD AS SATURNINUS MAY 
THEN WHY SHOULD HE DESPAIR THAT KNOWS TO COURT IT
WITH WORDS FAIR LOOKS AND LIBERALITY
WHAT HAST NOT THOU FULL OFTEN STRUCK A DOE
AND BORNE HER CLEANLY BY THE KEEPERS NOSE
WHY THEN IT SEEMS SOME CERTAIN SNATCH OR SO
WOULD SERVE YOUR TURNS 
AY SO THE TURN WERE SERVED 
AARON THOU HAST HIT IT 
WOULD YOU HAD HIT IT TOO 
THEN SHOULD NOT WE BE TIRED WITH THIS ADO 
WHY HARK YE HARK YE  AND ARE YOU SUCH FOOLS
TO SQUARE FOR THIS WOULD IT OFFEND YOU THEN
THAT BOTH SHOULD SPEED
FAITH NOT ME 
NOR ME SO I WERE ONE 
FOR SHAME BE FRIENDS AND JOIN FOR THAT YOU JAR
TIS POLICY AND STRATAGEM MUST DO
THAT YOU AFFECT AND SO MUST YOU RESOLVE
THAT WHAT YOU CANNOT AS YOU WOULD ACHIEVE
YOU MUST PERFORCE ACCOMPLISH AS YOU MAY 
TAKE THIS OF ME LUCRECE WAS NOT MORE CHASTE
THAN THIS LAVINIA BASSIANUS LOVE 
A SPEEDIER COURSE THAN LINGERING LANGUISHMENT
MUST WE PURSUE AND I HAVE FOUND THE PATH 
MY LORDS A SOLEMN HUNTING IS IN HAND
THERE WILL THE LOVELY ROMAN LADIES TROOP
THE FOREST WALKS ARE WIDE AND SPACIOUS
AND MANY UNFREQUENTED PLOTS THERE ARE
FITTED BY KIND FOR RAPE AND VILLANY
SINGLE YOU THITHER THEN THIS DAINTY DOE
AND STRIKE HER HOME BY FORCE IF NOT BY WORDS
THIS WAY OR NOT AT ALL STAND YOU IN HOPE 
COME COME OUR EMPRESS WITH HER SACRED WIT
TO VILLANY AND VENGEANCE CONSECRATE
WILL WE ACQUAINT WITH ALL THAT WE INTEND
AND SHE SHALL FILE OUR ENGINES WITH ADVICE
THAT WILL NOT SUFFER YOU TO SQUARE YOURSELVES
BUT TO YOUR WISHES HEIGHT ADVANCE YOU BOTH 
THE EMPERORS COURT IS LIKE THE HOUSE OF FAME
THE PALACE FULL OF TONGUES OF EYES AND EARS
THE WOODS ARE RUTHLESS DREADFUL DEAF AND DULL
THERE SPEAK AND STRIKE BRAVE BOYS AND TAKE
YOUR TURNS
THERE SERVE YOUR LUSTS SHADOWD FROM HEAVENS EYE
AND REVEL IN LAVINIAS TREASURY 
THY COUNSEL LAD SMELLS OF NO COWARDICE
SIT FAS AUT NEFAS TILL I FIND THE STREAM
TO COOL THIS HEAT A CHARM TO CALM THESE FITS 
PER STYGA PER MANES VEHOR 
THE HUNT IS UP THE MORN IS BRIGHT AND GREY
THE FIELDS ARE FRAGRANT AND THE WOODS ARE GREEN
UNCOUPLE HERE AND LET US MAKE A BAY
AND WAKE THE EMPEROR AND HIS LOVELY BRIDE
AND ROUSE THE PRINCE AND RING A HUNTERS PEAL
THAT ALL THE COURT MAY ECHO WITH THE NOISE 
SONS LET IT BE YOUR CHARGE AS IT IS OURS
TO ATTEND THE EMPERORS PERSON CAREFULLY
I HAVE BEEN TROUBLED IN MY SLEEP THIS NIGHT
BUT DAWNING DAY NEW COMFORT HATH INSPIRED 
MANY GOOD MORROWS TO YOUR MAJESTY
MADAM TO YOU AS MANY AND AS GOOD
I PROMISED YOUR GRACE A HUNTERS PEAL 
AND YOU HAVE RUNG IT LUSTILY MY LORD
SOMEWHAT TOO EARLY FOR NEWMARRIED LADIES 
LAVINIA HOW SAY YOU
I SAY NO
I HAVE BEEN BROAD AWAKE TWO HOURS AND MORE 
COME ON THEN HORSE AND CHARIOTS LET US HAVE
AND TO OUR SPORT 
MADAM NOW SHALL YE SEE
OUR ROMAN HUNTING 
I HAVE DOGS MY LORD
WILL ROUSE THE PROUDEST PANTHER IN THE CHASE
AND CLIMB THE HIGHEST PROMONTORY TOP 
AND I HAVE HORSE WILL FOLLOW WHERE THE GAME
MAKES WAY AND RUN LIKE SWALLOWS OER THE PLAIN 
CHIRON WE HUNT NOT WE WITH HORSE NOR HOUND
BUT HOPE TO PLUCK A DAINTY DOE TO GROUND 
HE THAT HAD WIT WOULD THINK THAT I HAD NONE
TO BURY SO MUCH GOLD UNDER A TREE
AND NEVER AFTER TO INHERIT IT 
LET HIM THAT THINKS OF ME SO ABJECTLY
KNOW THAT THIS GOLD MUST COIN A STRATAGEM
WHICH CUNNINGLY EFFECTED WILL BEGET
A VERY EXCELLENT PIECE OF VILLANY
AND SO REPOSE SWEET GOLD FOR THEIR UNREST
THAT HAVE THEIR ALMS OUT OF THE EMPRESS CHEST 
MY LOVELY AARON WHEREFORE LOOKST THOU SAD
WHEN EVERY THING DOTH MAKE A GLEEFUL BOAST
THE BIRDS CHANT MELODY ON EVERY BUSH
THE SNAKE LIES ROLLED IN THE CHEERFUL SUN
THE GREEN LEAVES QUIVER WITH THE COOLING WIND
AND MAKE A CHEQUERD SHADOW ON THE GROUND
UNDER THEIR SWEET SHADE AARON LET US SIT
AND WHILST THE BABBLING ECHO MOCKS THE HOUNDS
REPLYING SHRILLY TO THE WELLTUNED HORNS
AS IF A DOUBLE HUNT WERE HEARD AT ONCE
LET US SIT DOWN AND MARK THEIR YELPING NOISE
AND AFTER CONFLICT SUCH AS WAS SUPPOSED
THE WANDERING PRINCE AND DIDO ONCE ENJOYD
WHEN WITH A HAPPY STORM THEY WERE SURPRISED
AND CURTAIND WITH A COUNSELKEEPING CAVE
WE MAY EACH WREATHED IN THE OTHERS ARMS
OUR PASTIMES DONE POSSESS A GOLDEN SLUMBER
WHILES HOUNDS AND HORNS AND SWEET MELODIOUS BIRDS
BE UNTO US AS IS A NURSES SONG
OF LULLABY TO BRING HER BABE ASLEEP 
MADAM THOUGH VENUS GOVERN YOUR DESIRES
SATURN IS DOMINATOR OVER MINE
WHAT SIGNIFIES MY DEADLYSTANDING EYE
MY SILENCE AND MY CLOUDY MELANCHOLY
MY FLEECE OF WOOLLY HAIR THAT NOW UNCURLS
EVEN AS AN ADDER WHEN SHE DOTH UNROLL
TO DO SOME FATAL EXECUTION
NO MADAM THESE ARE NO VENEREAL SIGNS
VENGEANCE IS IN MY HEART DEATH IN MY HAND
BLOOD AND REVENGE ARE HAMMERING IN MY HEAD 
HARK TAMORA THE EMPRESS OF MY SOUL
WHICH NEVER HOPES MORE HEAVEN THAN RESTS IN THEE
THIS IS THE DAY OF DOOM FOR BASSIANUS
HIS PHILOMEL MUST LOSE HER TONGUE TODAY
THY SONS MAKE PILLAGE OF HER CHASTITY
AND WASH THEIR HANDS IN BASSIANUS BLOOD 
SEEST THOU THIS LETTER TAKE IT UP I PRAY THEE

WHO HAVE WE HERE ROMES ROYAL EMPRESS
UNFURNISHD OF HER WELLBESEEMING TROOP
OR IS IT DIAN HABITED LIKE HER
WHO HATH ABANDONED HER HOLY GROVES
TO SEE THE GENERAL HUNTING IN THIS FOREST
SAUCY CONTROLLER OF OUR PRIVATE STEPS 
HAD I THE POWER THAT SOME SAY DIAN HAD
THY TEMPLES SHOULD BE PLANTED PRESENTLY
WITH HORNS AS WAS ACTAEONS AND THE HOUNDS

UNMANNERLY INTRUDER AS THOU ART 
UNDER YOUR PATIENCE GENTLE EMPRESS
TIS THOUGHT YOU HAVE A GOODLY GIFT IN HORNING
AND TO BE DOUBTED THAT YOUR MOOR AND YOU
ARE SINGLED FORTH TO TRY EXPERIMENTS

TIS PITY THEY SHOULD TAKE HIM FOR A STAG 
BELIEVE ME QUEEN YOUR SWARTH CIMMERIAN
DOTH MAKE YOUR HONOUR OF HIS BODYS HUE
SPOTTED DETESTED AND ABOMINABLE 
WHY ARE YOU SEQUESTERD FROM ALL YOUR TRAIN
DISMOUNTED FROM YOUR SNOWWHITE GOODLY STEED 
AND WANDERD HITHER TO AN OBSCURE PLOT
ACCOMPANIED BUT WITH A BARBAROUS MOOR
IF FOUL DESIRE HAD NOT CONDUCTED YOU
AND BEING INTERCEPTED IN YOUR SPORT
GREAT REASON THAT MY NOBLE LORD BE RATED
FOR SAUCINESS  I PRAY YOU LET US HENCE
AND LET HER JOY HER RAVENCOLOURD LOVE
THIS VALLEY FITS THE PURPOSE PASSING WELL 
THE KING MY BROTHER SHALL HAVE NOTE OF THIS 
AY FOR THESE SLIPS HAVE MADE HIM NOTED LONG
GOOD KING TO BE SO MIGHTILY ABUSED 
WHY HAVE I PATIENCE TO ENDURE ALL THIS
HOW NOW DEAR SOVEREIGN AND OUR GRACIOUS MOTHER 
WHY DOTH YOUR HIGHNESS LOOK SO PALE AND WAN

THESE TWO HAVE TICED ME HITHER TO THIS PLACE
A BARREN DETESTED VALE YOU SEE IT IS
THE TREES THOUGH SUMMER YET FORLORN AND LEAN
OERCOME WITH MOSS AND BALEFUL MISTLETOE
HERE NEVER SHINES THE SUN HERE NOTHING BREEDS
UNLESS THE NIGHTLY OWL OR FATAL RAVEN
AND WHEN THEY SHOWD ME THIS ABHORRED PIT
THEY TOLD ME HERE AT DEAD TIME OF THE NIGHT
A THOUSAND FIENDS A THOUSAND HISSING SNAKES
TEN THOUSAND SWELLING TOADS AS MANY URCHINS
WOULD MAKE SUCH FEARFUL AND CONFUSED CRIES
AS ANY MORTAL BODY HEARING IT
SHOULD STRAIGHT FALL MAD OR ELSE DIE SUDDENLY 
NO SOONER HAD THEY TOLD THIS HELLISH TALE
BUT STRAIGHT THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD BIND ME HERE
UNTO THE BODY OF A DISMAL YEW
AND LEAVE ME TO THIS MISERABLE DEATH
AND THEN THEY CALLD ME FOUL ADULTERESS
LASCIVIOUS GOTH AND ALL THE BITTEREST TERMS
THAT EVER EAR DID HEAR TO SUCH EFFECT
AND HAD YOU NOT BY WONDROUS FORTUNE COME
THIS VENGEANCE ON ME HAD THEY EXECUTED 
REVENGE IT AS YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHERS LIFE

EVEN AT THY TEAT THOU HADST THY TYRANNY 
YET EVERY MOTHER BREEDS NOT SONS ALIKE

TIS TRUE THE RAVEN DOTH NOT HATCH A LARK

WHY DOST NOT COMFORT ME AND HELP ME OUT

A PRECIOUS RING THAT LIGHTENS ALL THE HOLE
WHICH LIKE A TAPER IN SOME MONUMENT

COMING AND GOING WITH THY HONEY BREATH 
BUT SURE SOME TEREUS HATH DEFLOWERED THEE
AND LEST THOU SHOULDST DETECT HIM CUT THY TONGUE 
AH NOW THOU TURNST AWAY THY FACE FOR SHAME 
AND NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS LOSS OF BLOOD

SHALL I SPEAK FOR THEE SHALL I SAY TIS SO
O THAT I KNEW THY HEART AND KNEW THE BEAST
THAT I MIGHT RAIL AT HIM TO EASE MY MIND 
SORROW CONCEALED LIKE AN OVEN STOPPD
DOTH BURN THE HEART TO CINDERS WHERE IT IS 
FAIR PHILOMELA SHE BUT LOST HER TONGUE
AND IN A TEDIOUS SAMPLER SEWD HER MIND
BUT LOVELY NIECE THAT MEAN IS CUT FROM THEE
A CRAFTIER TEREUS COUSIN HAST THOU MET
AND HE HATH CUT THOSE PRETTY FINGERS OFF
THAT COULD HAVE BETTER SEWD THAN PHILOMEL 
O HAD THE MONSTER SEEN THOSE LILY HANDS
TREMBLE LIKE ASPENLEAVES UPON A LUTE
AND MAKE THE SILKEN STRINGS DELIGHT TO KISS THEM
HE WOULD NOT THEN HAVE TOUCHD THEM FOR HIS LIFE 
OR HAD HE HEARD THE HEAVENLY HARMONY
WHICH THAT SWEET TONGUE HATH MADE
HE WOULD HAVE DROPPD HIS KNIFE AND FELL ASLEEP
AS CERBERUS AT THE THRACIAN POETS FEET 
COME LET US GO AND MAKE THY FATHER BLIND
FOR SUCH A SIGHT WILL BLIND A FATHERS EYE
ONE HOURS STORM WILL DROWN THE FRAGRANT MEADS
WHAT WILL WHOLE MONTHS OF TEARS THY FATHERS EYES
DO NOT DRAW BACK FOR WE WILL MOURN WITH THEE
O COULD OUR MOURNING EASE THY MISERY 
HEAR ME GRAVE FATHERS  NOBLE TRIBUNES STAY 
FOR PITY OF MINE AGE WHOSE YOUTH WAS SPENT
IN DANGEROUS WARS WHILST YOU SECURELY SLEPT
FOR ALL MY BLOOD IN ROMES GREAT QUARREL SHED
FOR ALL THE FROSTY NIGHTS THAT I HAVE WATCHD
AND FOR THESE BITTER TEARS WHICH NOW YOU SEE
FILLING THE AGED WRINKLES IN MY CHEEKS
BE PITIFUL TO MY CONDEMNED SONS
WHOSE SOULS ARE NOT CORRUPTED AS TIS THOUGHT 
FOR TWO AND TWENTY SONS I NEVER WEPT
BECAUSE THEY DIED IN HONOURS LOFTY BED 
FOR THESE THESE TRIBUNES IN THE DUST I WRITE
MY HEARTS DEEP LANGUOR AND MY SOULS SAD TEARS
LET MY TEARS STANCH THE EARTHS DRY APPETITE
MY SONS SWEET BLOOD WILL MAKE IT SHAME AND BLUSH 
O EARTH I WILL BEFRIEND THEE MORE WITH RAIN
THAT SHALL DISTIL FROM THESE TWO ANCIENT URNS
THAN YOUTHFUL APRIL SHALL WITH ALL HIS SHOWERS
IN SUMMERS DROUGHT ILL DROP UPON THEE STILL
IN WINTER WITH WARM TEARS ILL MELT THE SNOW
AND KEEP ETERNAL SPRINGTIME ON THY FACE
SO THOU REFUSE TO DRINK MY DEAR SONS BLOOD 
O REVEREND TRIBUNES  O GENTLE AGED MEN 
UNBIND MY SONS REVERSE THE DOOM OF DEATH
AND LET ME SAY THAT NEVER WEPT BEFORE
MY TEARS ARE NOW PREVAILING ORATORS 
O NOBLE FATHER YOU LAMENT IN VAIN
THE TRIBUNES HEAR YOU NOT NO MAN IS BY
AND YOU RECOUNT YOUR SORROWS TO A STONE 
AH LUCIUS FOR THY BROTHERS LET ME PLEAD 
GRAVE TRIBUNES ONCE MORE I ENTREAT OF YOU 
MY GRACIOUS LORD NO TRIBUNE HEARS YOU SPEAK 
WHY TIS NO MATTER MAN IF THEY DID HEAR
THEY WOULD NOT MARK ME OR IF THEY DID MARK
THEY WOULD NOT PITY ME YET PLEAD I MUST
AND BOOTLESS UNTO THEM 
THEREFORE I TELL MY SORROWS TO THE STONES
WHO THOUGH THEY CANNOT ANSWER MY DISTRESS
YET IN SOME SORT THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE TRIBUNES
FOR THAT THEY WILL NOT INTERCEPT MY TALE
WHEN I DO WEEP THEY HUMBLY AT MY FEET
RECEIVE MY TEARS AND SEEM TO WEEP WITH ME
AND WERE THEY BUT ATTIRED IN GRAVE WEEDS
ROME COULD AFFORD NO TRIBUNE LIKE TO THESE 
A STONE IS SOFT AS WAX TRIBUNES MORE HARD THAN STONES
A STONE IS SILENT AND OFFENDETH NOT
AND TRIBUNES WITH THEIR TONGUES DOOM MEN TO DEATH 
BUT WHEREFORE STANDST THOU WITH THY WEAPON DRAWN
TO RESCUE MY TWO BROTHERS FROM THEIR DEATH
FOR WHICH ATTEMPT THE JUDGES HAVE PRONOUNCED
MY EVERLASTING DOOM OF BANISHMENT 
O HAPPY MAN  THEY HAVE BEFRIENDED THEE 
WHY FOOLISH LUCIUS DOST THOU NOT PERCEIVE
THAT ROME IS BUT A WILDERNESS OF TIGERS
TIGERS MUST PREY AND ROME AFFORDS NO PREY
BUT ME AND MINE HOW HAPPY ART THOU THEN
FROM THESE DEVOURERS TO BE BANISHED 
BUT WHO COMES WITH OUR BROTHER MARCUS HERE
TITUS PREPARE THY AGED EYES TO WEEP
OR IF NOT SO THY NOBLE HEART TO BREAK
I BRING CONSUMING SORROW TO THINE AGE 
WILL IT CONSUME ME LET ME SEE IT THEN 
THIS WAS THY DAUGHTER 
WHY MARCUS SO SHE IS 
AY ME THIS OBJECT KILLS ME 
FAINTHEARTED BOY ARISE AND LOOK UPON HER 
SPEAK LAVINIA WHAT ACCURSED HAND
HATH MADE THEE HANDLESS IN THY FATHERS SIGHT
WHAT FOOL HATH ADDED WATER TO THE SEA
OR BROUGHT A FAGGOT TO BRIGHTBURNING TROY
MY GRIEF WAS AT THE HEIGHT BEFORE THOU CAMEST
AND NOW LIKE NILUS IT DISDAINETH BOUNDS 
GIVE ME A SWORD ILL CHOP OFF MY HANDS TOO
FOR THEY HAVE FOUGHT FOR ROME AND ALL IN VAIN
AND THEY HAVE NURSED THIS WOE IN FEEDING LIFE
IN BOOTLESS PRAYER HAVE THEY BEEN HELD UP
AND THEY HAVE SERVED ME TO EFFECTLESS USE
NOW ALL THE SERVICE I REQUIRE OF THEM
IS THAT THE ONE WILL HELP TO CUT THE OTHER 
TIS WELL LAVINIA THAT THOU HAST NO HANDS
FOR HANDS TO DO ROME SERVICE ARE BUT VAIN 
SPEAK GENTLE SISTER WHO HATH MARTYRD THEE
O THAT DELIGHTFUL ENGINE OF HER THOUGHTS
THAT BLABBD THEM WITH SUCH PLEASING ELOQUENCE
IS TORN FROM FORTH THAT PRETTY HOLLOW CAGE
WHERE LIKE A SWEET MELODIOUS BIRD IT SUNG
SWEET VARIED NOTES ENCHANTING EVERY EAR 
O SAY THOU FOR HER WHO HATH DONE THIS DEED
O THUS I FOUND HER STRAYING IN THE PARK
SEEKING TO HIDE HERSELF AS DOTH THE DEER
THAT HATH RECEIVED SOME UNRECURING WOUND 
IT WAS MY DEER AND HE THAT WOUNDED HER
HATH HURT ME MORE THAN HAD HE KILLED ME DEAD
FOR NOW I STAND AS ONE UPON A ROCK
ENVIRONED WITH A WILDERNESS OF SEA
WHO MARKS THE WAXING TIDE GROW WAVE BY WAVE
EXPECTING EVER WHEN SOME ENVIOUS SURGE
WILL IN HIS BRINISH BOWELS SWALLOW HIM 
THIS WAY TO DEATH MY WRETCHED SONS ARE GONE
HERE STANDS MY OTHER SON A BANISHED MAN
AND HERE MY BROTHER WEEPING AT MY WOES 
BUT THAT WHICH GIVES MY SOUL THE GREATEST SPURN
IS DEAR LAVINIA DEARER THAN MY SOUL 
HAD I BUT SEEN THY PICTURE IN THIS PLIGHT
IT WOULD HAVE MADDED ME WHAT SHALL I DO
NOW I BEHOLD THY LIVELY BODY SO
THOU HAST NO HANDS TO WIPE AWAY THY TEARS
NOR TONGUE TO TELL ME WHO HATH MARTYRD THEE
THY HUSBAND HE IS DEAD AND FOR HIS DEATH
THY BROTHERS ARE CONDEMND AND DEAD BY THIS 
LOOK MARCUS  AH SON LUCIUS LOOK ON HER 
WHEN I DID NAME HER BROTHERS THEN FRESH TEARS
STOOD ON HER CHEEKS AS DOTH THE HONEYDEW
UPON A GATHERD LILY ALMOST WITHERD 
PERCHANCE SHE WEEPS BECAUSE THEY KILLD HER HUSBAND
PERCHANCE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THEM INNOCENT 
IF THEY DID KILL THY HUSBAND THEN BE JOYFUL
BECAUSE THE LAW HATH TAEN REVENGE ON THEM 
NO NO THEY WOULD NOT DO SO FOUL A DEED
WITNESS THE SORROW THAT THEIR SISTER MAKES 
GENTLE LAVINIA LET ME KISS THY LIPS 
OR MAKE SOME SIGN HOW I MAY DO THEE EASE
SHALL THY GOOD UNCLE AND THY BROTHER LUCIUS
AND THOU AND I SIT ROUND ABOUT SOME FOUNTAIN
LOOKING ALL DOWNWARDS TO BEHOLD OUR CHEEKS
HOW THEY ARE STAIND AS MEADOWS YET NOT DRY
WITH MIRY SLIME LEFT ON THEM BY A FLOOD
AND IN THE FOUNTAIN SHALL WE GAZE SO LONG
TILL THE FRESH TASTE BE TAKEN FROM THAT CLEARNESS
AND MADE A BRINEPIT WITH OUR BITTER TEARS
OR SHALL WE CUT AWAY OUR HANDS LIKE THINE
OR SHALL WE BITE OUR TONGUES AND IN DUMB SHOWS
PASS THE REMAINDER OF OUR HATEFUL DAYS
WHAT SHALL WE DO LET US THAT HAVE OUR TONGUES
PLOT SOME DEUCE OF FURTHER MISERY
TO MAKE US WONDERD AT IN TIME TO COME 
SWEET FATHER CEASE YOUR TEARS FOR AT YOUR GRIEF
SEE HOW MY WRETCHED SISTER SOBS AND WEEPS 
PATIENCE DEAR NIECE  GOOD TITUS DRY THINE EYES 
AH MARCUS MARCUS  BROTHER WELL I WOT

FOR THOU POOR MAN HAST DROWND IT WITH THINE OWN 
AH MY LAVINIA I WILL WIPE THY CHEEKS 
MARK MARCUS MARK  I UNDERSTAND HER SIGNS
HAD SHE A TONGUE TO SPEAK NOW WOULD SHE SAY
THAT TO HER BROTHER WHICH I SAID TO THEE
HIS NAPKIN WITH HIS TRUE TEARS ALL BEWET
CAN DO NO SERVICE ON HER SORROWFUL CHEEKS 
O WHAT A SYMPATHY OF WOE IS THIS
AS FAR FROM HELP AS LIMBO IS FROM BLISS 
TITUS ANDRONICUS MY LORD THE EMPEROR
SENDS THEE THIS WORD THAT IF THOU LOVE THY SONS
LET MARCUS LUCIUS OR THYSELF OLD TITUS
OR ANY ONE OF YOU CHOP OFF YOUR HAND
AND SEND IT TO THE KING HE FOR THE SAME

BUT YET LET REASON GOVERN THY LAMENT 
IF THERE WERE REASON FOR THESE MISERIES
THEN INTO LIMITS COULD I BIND MY WOES
WHEN HEAVEN DOTH WEEP DOTH NOT THE EARTH OERFLOW
IF THE WINDS RAGE DOTH NOT THE SEA WAX MAD
THREATENING THE WELKIN WITH HIS BIGSWOLN FACE
AND WILT THOU HAVE A REASON FOR THIS COIL
I AM THE SEA HARK HOW HER SIGHS DO BLOW 
SHE IS THE WEEPING WELKIN I THE EARTH
THEN MUST MY SEA BE MOVED WITH HER SIGHS
THEN MUST MY EARTH WITH HER CONTINUAL TEARS
BECOME A DELUGE OVERFLOWD AND DROWND
FOR WHY MY BOWELS CANNOT HIDE HER WOES
BUT LIKE A DRUNKARD MUST I VOMIT THEM 
THEN GIVE ME LEAVE FOR LOSERS WILL HAVE LEAVE
TO EASE THEIR STOMACHS WITH THEIR BITTER TONGUES 
WORTHY ANDRONICUS ILL ART THOU REPAID
FOR THAT GOOD HAND THOU SENTST THE EMPEROR 
HERE ARE THE HEADS OF THY TWO NOBLE SONS
AND HERES THY HAND IN SCORN TO THEE SENT BACK
THY GRIEFS THEIR SPORTS THY RESOLUTION MOCKD
THAT WOE IS ME TO THINK UPON THY WOES
MORE THAN REMEMBRANCE OF MY FATHERS DEATH 
NOW LET HOT AETNA COOL IN SICILY
AND BE MY HEART AN EVERBURNING HELL 
THESE MISERIES ARE MORE THAN MAY BE BORNE 
TO WEEP WITH THEM THAT WEEP DOTH EASE SOME DEAL
BUT SORROW FLOUTED AT IS DOUBLE DEATH 
AH THAT THIS SIGHT SHOULD MAKE SO DEEP A WOUND
AND YET DETESTED LIFE NOT SHRINK THEREAT 
THAT EVER DEATH SHOULD LET LIFE BEAR HIS NAME
WHERE LIFE HATH NO MORE INTEREST BUT TO BREATHE 
ALAS POOR HEART THAT KISS IS COMFORTLESS
AS FROZEN WATER TO A STARVED SNAKE 
WHEN WILL THIS FEARFUL SLUMBER HAVE AN END
NOW FAREWELL FLATTERY DIE ANDRONICUS
THOU DOST NOT SLUMBER SEE THY TWO SONS HEADS
THY WARLIKE HAND THY MANGLED DAUGHTER HERE
THY OTHER BANISHD SON WITH THIS DEAR SIGHT
STRUCK PALE AND BLOODLESS AND THY BROTHER I
EVEN LIKE A STONY IMAGE COLD AND NUMB 
AH NOW NO MORE WILL I CONTROL THY GRIEFS
REND OFF THY SILVER HAIR THY OTHER HAND
GNAWING WITH THY TEETH AND BE THIS DISMAL SIGHT
THE CLOSING UP OF OUR MOST WRETCHED EYES
NOW IS A TIME TO STORM WHY ART THOU STILL
HA HA HA 
WHY DOST THOU LAUGH IT FITS NOT WITH THIS HOUR 
WHY I HAVE NOT ANOTHER TEAR TO SHED
BESIDES THIS SORROW IS AN ENEMY
AND WOULD USURP UPON MY WATERY EYES
AND MAKE THEM BLIND WITH TRIBUTARY TEARS
THEN WHICH WAY SHALL I FIND REVENGES CAVE
FOR THESE TWO HEADS DO SEEM TO SPEAK TO ME
AND THREAT ME I SHALL NEVER COME TO BLISS
TILL ALL THESE MISCHIEFS BE RETURND AGAIN
EVEN IN THEIR THROATS THAT HAVE COMMITTED THEM 
COME LET ME SEE WHAT TASK I HAVE TO DO 
YOU HEAVY PEOPLE CIRCLE ME ABOUT
THAT I MAY TURN ME TO EACH ONE OF YOU
AND SWEAR UNTO MY SOUL TO RIGHT YOUR WRONGS 
THE VOW IS MADE  COME BROTHER TAKE A HEAD
AND IN THIS HAND THE OTHER I WILL BEAR 
LAVINIA THOU SHALT BE EMPLOYD THESE ARMS 
BEAR THOU MY HAND SWEET WENCH BETWEEN THY TEETH 
AS FOR THEE BOY GO GET THEE FROM MY SIGHT

HIE TO THE GOTHS AND RAISE AN ARMY THERE
AND IF YOU LOVE ME AS I THINK YOU DO
LETS KISS AND PART FOR WE HAVE MUCH TO DO 
FAREWELL ANDRONICUS MY NOBLE FATHER

FAREWELL LAVINIA MY NOBLE SISTER

IF LUCIUS LIVE HE WILL REQUITE YOUR WRONGS

WOUND IT WITH SIGHING GIRL KILL IT WITH GROANS
OR GET SOME LITTLE KNIFE BETWEEN THY TEETH
AND JUST AGAINST THY HEART MAKE THOU A HOLE

CUT OFF THE PROUDST CONSPIRATOR THAT LIVES 
MY GRACIOUS LORD MY LOVELY SATURNINE
LORD OF MY LIFE COMMANDER OF MY THOUGHTS
CALM THEE AND BEAR THE FAULTS OF TITUS AGE
THE EFFECTS OF SORROW FOR HIS VALIANT SONS
WHOSE LOSS HATH PIERCED HIM DEEP AND SCARRD HIS HEART
AND RATHER COMFORT HIS DISTRESSED PLIGHT
THAN PROSECUTE THE MEANEST OR THE BEST
FOR THESE CONTEMPTS 
WHY THUS IT SHALL BECOME
HIGHWITTED TAMORA TO GLOZE WITH ALL
BUT TITUS I HAVE TOUCHED THEE TO THE QUICK
THY LIFEBLOOD OUT IF AARON NOW BE WISE
THEN IS ALL SAFE THE ANCHORS IN THE PORT 
HOW NOW GOOD FELLOW  WOULDST THOU SPEAK WITH US
YEA FORSOOTH AN YOUR MISTERSHIP BE EMPERIAL 
EMPRESS I AM BUT YONDER SITS THE EMPEROR 
TIS HE  GOD AND SAINT STEPHEN GIVE YOU GOOD DEN
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A LETTER AND A COUPLE OF PIGEONS HERE 
GO TAKE HIM AWAY AND HANG HIM PRESENTLY 
HOW MUCH MONEY MUST I HAVE
COME SIRRAH YOU MUST BE HANGED 
HANGED  BYR LADY THEN I HAVE BROUGHT UP A NECK TO
A FAIR END 
DESPITEFUL AND INTOLERABLE WRONGS 
SHALL I ENDURE THIS MONSTROUS VILLANY
I KNOW FROM WHENCE THIS SAME DEVICE PROCEEDS
MAY THIS BE BORNE AS IF HIS TRAITOROUS SONS
THAT DIED BY LAW FOR MURDER OF OUR BROTHER
HAVE BY MY MEANS BEEN BUTCHERD WRONGFULLY 
GO DRAG THE VILLAIN HITHER BY THE HAIR
NOR AGE NOR HONOUR SHALL SHAPE PRIVILEGE
FOR THIS PROUD MOCK ILL BE THY SLAUGHTERMAN
SLY FRANTIC WRETCH THAT HOLPST TO MAKE ME GREAT
IN HOPE THYSELF SHOULD GOVERN ROME AND ME 
WHAT NEWS WITH THEE AEMILIUS
ARM ARM MY LORD ROME NEVER HAD MORE CAUSE 
THE GOTHS HAVE GATHERD HEAD AND WITH A POWER
HIGHRESOLVED MEN BENT TO THE SPOIL
THEY HITHER MARCH AMAIN UNDER CONDUCT
OF LUCIUS SON TO OLD ANDRONICUS
WHO THREATS IN COURSE OF THIS REVENGE TO DO
AS MUCH AS EVER CORIOLANUS DID 
IS WARLIKE LUCIUS GENERAL OF THE GOTHS
THESE TIDINGS NIP ME AND I HANG THE HEAD
AS FLOWERS WITH FROST OR GRASS BEAT DOWN WITH STORMS
AY NOW BEGIN OUR SORROWS TO APPROACH
TIS HE THE COMMON PEOPLE LOVE SO MUCH
MYSELF HATH OFTEN OVERHEARD THEM SAY
WHEN I HAVE WALKED LIKE A PRIVATE MAN
THAT LUCIUS BANISHMENT WAS WRONGFULLY
AND THEY HAVE WISHD THAT LUCIUS WERE THEIR EMPEROR 
WHY SHOULD YOU FEAR IS NOT YOUR CITY STRONG
AY BUT THE CITIZENS FAVOR LUCIUS
AND WILL REVOLT FROM ME TO SUCCOR HIM 
KING BE THY THOUGHTS IMPERIOUS LIKE THY NAME 
IS THE SUN DIMMD THAT GNATS DO FLY IN IT
THE EAGLE SUFFERS LITTLE BIRDS TO SING
AND IS NOT CAREFUL WHAT THEY MEAN THEREBY
KNOWING THAT WITH THE SHADOW OF HIS WINGS
HE CAN AT PLEASURE STINT THEIR MELODY
EVEN SO MAYST THOU THE GIDDY MEN OF ROME 
THEN CHEER THY SPIRIT  FOR KNOW THOU EMPEROR
I WILL ENCHANT THE OLD ANDRONICUS
WITH WORDS MORE SWEET AND YET MORE DANGEROUS
THAN BAITS TO FISH OR HONEYSTALKS TO SHEEP
WHEN AS THE ONE IS WOUNDED WITH THE BAIT
THE OTHER ROTTED WITH DELICIOUS FEED 
BUT HE WILL NOT ENTREAT HIS SON FOR US 
IF TAMORA ENTREAT HIM THEN HE WILL
FOR I CAN SMOOTH AND FILL HIS AGED EAR
WITH GOLDEN PROMISES THAT WERE HIS HEART
ALMOST IMPREGNABLE HIS OLD EARS DEAF
YET SHOULD BOTH EAR AND HEART OBEY MY TONGUE 
GO THOU BEFORE BE OUR AMBASSADOR
SAY THAT THE EMPEROR REQUESTS A PARLEY
OF WARLIKE LUCIUS AND APPOINT THE MEETING
EVEN AT HIS FATHERS HOUSE THE OLD ANDRONICUS 
AEMILIUS DO THIS MESSAGE HONOURABLY
AND IF HE STAND ON HOSTAGE FOR HIS SAFETY
BID HIM DEMAND WHAT PLEDGE WILL PLEASE HIM BEST 
YOUR BIDDING SHALL I DO EFFECTUALLY 
NOW WILL I TO THAT OLD ANDRONICUS
AND TEMPER HIM WITH ALL THE ART I HAVE
TO PLUCK PROUD LUCIUS FROM THE WARLIKE GOTHS 
AND NOW SWEET EMPEROR BE BLITHE AGAIN
AND BURY ALL THY FEAR IN MY DEVICES 
THEN GO SUCCESSANTLY AND PLEAD TO HIM 
APPROVED WARRIORS AND MY FAITHFUL FRIENDS
I HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS FROM GREAT ROME
WHICH SIGNIFY WHAT HATE THEY BEAR THEIR EMPEROR
AND HOW DESIROUS OF OUR SIGHT THEY ARE 
THEREFORE GREAT LORDS BE AS YOUR TITLES WITNESS
IMPERIOUS AND IMPATIENT OF YOUR WRONGS
AND WHEREIN ROME HATH DONE YOU ANY SCATH
LET HIM MAKE TREBLE SATISFACTION 
BRAVE SLIP SPRUNG FROM THE GREAT ANDRONICUS
WHOSE NAME WAS ONCE OUR TERROR NOW OUR COMFORT
WHOSE HIGH EXPLOITS AND HONOURABLE DEEDS
INGRATEFUL ROME REQUITES WITH FOUL CONTEMPT
BE BOLD IN US WELL FOLLOW WHERE THOU LEADST
LIKE STINGING BEES IN HOTTEST SUMMERS DAY
LED BY THEIR MASTER TO THE FLOWERED FIELDS
AND BE AVENGED ON CURSED TAMORA 
AND AS HE SAITH SO SAY WE ALL WITH HIM 
I HUMBLY THANK HIM AND I THANK YOU ALL 
BUT WHO COMES HERE LED BY A LUSTY GOTH
RENOWNED LUCIUS FROM OUR TROOPS I STRAYD
TO GAZE UPON A RUINOUS MONASTERY
AND AS I EARNESTLY DID FIX MINE EYE

WILL HOLD THEE DEARLY FOR THY MOTHERS SAKE 
WITH THIS MY WEAPON DRAWN I RUSHD UPON HIM
SURPRISED HIM SUDDENLY AND BROUGHT HIM HITHER
TO USE AS YOU THINK NEEDFUL OF THE MAN 
O WORTHY GOTH THIS IS THE INCARNATE DEVIL
THAT ROBBD ANDRONICUS OF HIS GOOD HAND
THIS IS THE PEARL THAT PLEASED YOUR EMPRESS EYE
AND HERES THE BASE FRUIT OF HIS BURNING LUST 
SAY WALLEYED SLAVE WHITHER WOULDST THOU CONVEY
THIS GROWING IMAGE OF THY FIENDLIKE FACE
WHY DOST NOT SPEAK WHAT DEAF NOT A WORD
A HALTER SOLDIERS  HANG HIM ON THIS TREE 
AND BY HIS SIDE HIS FRUIT OF BASTARDY

AND THIS SHALL ALL BE BURIED BY MY DEATH
UNLESS THOU SWEAR TO ME MY CHILD SHALL LIVE 
TELL ON THY MIND I SAY THY CHILD SHALL LIVE 
SWEAR THAT HE SHALL AND THEN I WILL BEGIN 
WHO SHOULD I SWEAR BY THOU BELIEVEST NO GOD
THAT GRANTED HOW CANST THOU BELIEVE AN OATH

AND HAST A THING WITHIN THEE CALLED CONSCIENCE
WITH TWENTY POPISH TRICKS AND CEREMONIES
WHICH I HAVE SEEN THEE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE
THEREFORE I URGE THY OATH FOR THAT I KNOW

TO SAVE MY BOY TO NOURISH AND BRING HIM UP
OR ELSE I WILL DISCOVER NOUGHT TO THEE 
EVEN BY MY GOD I SWEAR TO THEE I WILL 
FIRST KNOW THOU I BEGOT HIM ON THE EMPRESS 
O MOST INSATIATE AND LUXURIOUS WOMAN 
TUT LUCIUS THIS WAS BUT A DEED OF CHARITY
TO THAT WHICH THOU SHALT HEAR OF ME ANON 
TWAS HER TWO SONS THAT MURDERD BASSIANUS
THEY CUT THY SISTERS TONGUE AND RAVISHD HER
AND CUT HER HANDS AND TRIMMD HER AS THOU SAWST 
O DETESTABLE VILLAIN  CALLST THOU THAT TRIMMING
WHY SHE WAS WASHD AND CUT AND TRIMMD AND TWAS
TRIM SPORT FOR THEM THAT HAD THE DOING OF IT 
O BARBAROUS BEASTLY VILLAINS LIKE THYSELF 
INDEED I WAS THEIR TUTOR TO INSTRUCT THEM
THAT CODDING SPIRIT HAD THEY FROM THEIR MOTHER
AS SURE A CARD AS EVER WON THE SET
THAT BLOODY MIND I THINK THEY LEARND OF ME
AS TRUE A DOG AS EVER FOUGHT AT HEAD 
WELL LET MY DEEDS BE WITNESS OF MY WORTH 
I TRAIND THY BRETHREN TO THAT GUILEFUL HOLE
WHERE THE DEAD CORPSE OF BASSIANUS LAY
I WROTE THE LETTER THAT THY FATHER FOUND
AND HID THE GOLD WITHIN THE LETTER MENTIOND
CONFEDERATE WITH THE QUEEN AND HER TWO SONS
AND WHAT NOT DONE THAT THOU HAST CAUSE TO RUE
WHEREIN I HAD NO STROKE OF MISCHIEF IN IT
I PLAYD THE CHEATER FOR THY FATHERS HAND
AND WHEN I HAD IT DREW MYSELF APART
AND ALMOST BROKE MY HEART WITH EXTREME LAUGHTER
I PRYD ME THROUGH THE CREVICE OF A WALL
WHEN FOR HIS HAND HE HAD HIS TWO SONS HEADS
BEHELD HIS TEARS AND LAUGHD SO HEARTILY
THAT BOTH MINE EYES WERE RAINY LIKE TO HIS 
AND WHEN I TOLD THE EMPRESS OF THIS SPORT
SHE SWOONED ALMOST AT MY PLEASING TALE
AND FOR MY TIDINGS GAVE ME TWENTY KISSES 
WHAT CANST THOU SAY ALL THIS AND NEVER BLUSH
AY LIKE A BLACK DOG AS THE SAYING IS 
ART THOU NOT SORRY FOR THESE HEINOUS DEEDS
AY THAT I HAD NOT DONE A THOUSAND MORE 
EVEN NOW I CURSE THE DAY AND YET I THINK
FEW COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY CURSE 
WHEREIN I DID NOT SOME NOTORIOUS ILL
AS KILL A MAN OR ELSE DEVISE HIS DEATH
RAVISH A MAID OR PLOT THE WAY TO DO IT
ACCUSE SOME INNOCENT AND FORSWEAR MYSELF
SET DEADLY ENMITY BETWEEN TWO FRIENDS
MAKE POOR MENS CATTLE BREAK THEIR NECKS
SET FIRE ON BARNS AND HAYSTACKS IN THE NIGHT
AND BID THE OWNERS QUENCH THEM WITH THEIR TEARS 
OFT HAVE I DIGGD UP DEAD MEN FROM THEIR GRAVES
AND SET THEM UPRIGHT AT THEIR DEAR FRIENDS DOORS
EVEN WHEN THEIR SORROWS ALMOST WERE FORGOT
AND ON THEIR SKINS AS ON THE BARK OF TREES
HAVE WITH MY KNIFE CARVED IN ROMAN LETTERS
LET NOT YOUR SORROW DIE THOUGH I AM DEAD 
TUT I HAVE DONE A THOUSAND DREADFUL THINGS
AS WILLINGLY AS ONE WOULD KILL A FLY
AND NOTHING GRIEVES ME HEARTILY INDEED
BUT THAT I CANNOT DO TEN THOUSAND MORE 
BRING DOWN THE DEVIL FOR HE MUST NOT DIE
SO SWEET A DEATH AS HANGING PRESENTLY 
IF THERE BE DEVILS WOULD I WERE A DEVIL
TO LIVE AND BURN IN EVERLASTING FIRE
SO I MIGHT HAVE YOUR COMPANY IN HELL

TO MELT IN SHOWERS THY GRANDSIRE LOVED THEE WELL
MANY A TIME HE DANCED THEE ON HIS KNEE
SUNG THEE ASLEEP HIS LOVING BREAST THY PILLOW
MANY A MATTER HATH HE TOLD TO THEE
MEET AND AGREEING WITH THINE INFANCY
IN THAT RESPECT THEN LIKE A LOVING CHILD
SHED YET SOME SMALL DROPS FROM THY TENDER SPRING
BECAUSE KIND NATURE DOTH REQUIRE IT SO
FRIENDS SHOULD ASSOCIATE FRIENDS IN GRIEF AND WOE
BID HIM FAREWELL COMMIT HIM TO THE GRAVE
DO HIM THAT KINDNESS AND TAKE LEAVE OF HIM 
O GRANDSIRE GRANDSIRE  EVEN WITH ALL MY HEART
WOULD I WERE DEAD SO YOU DID LIVE AGAIN 
O LORD I CANNOT SPEAK TO HIM FOR WEEPING
MY TEARS WILL CHOKE ME IF I OPE MY MOUTH 
YOU SAD ANDRONICI HAVE DONE WITH WOES
GIVE SENTENCE ON THIS EXECRABLE WRETCH
THAT HATH BEEN BREEDER OF THESE DIRE EVENTS 
SET HIM BREASTDEEP IN EARTH AND FAMISH HIM
THERE LET HIM STAND AND RAVE AND CRY FOR FOOD
IF ANY ONE RELIEVES OR PITIES HIM
FOR THE OFFENCE HE DIES  THIS IS OUR DOOM
SOME STAY TO SEE HIM FASTEND IN THE EARTH 
O WHY SHOULD WRATH BE MUTE AND FURY DUMB
I AM NO BABY I THAT WITH BASE PRAYERS
I SHOULD REPENT THE EVILS I HAVE DONE
TEN THOUSAND WORSE THAN EVER YET I DID
WOULD I PERFORM IF I MIGHT HAVE MY WILL
IF ONE GOOD DEED IN ALL MY LIFE I DID
I DO REPENT IT FROM MY VERY SOUL 
SOME LOVING FRIENDS CONVEY THE EMPEROR HENCE
AND GIVE HIM BURIAL IN HIS FATHERS GRAVE
MY FATHER AND LAVINIA SHALL FORTHWITH
BE CLOSED IN OUR HOUSEHOLDS MONUMENT 
AS FOR THAT HEINOUS TIGER TAMORA
NO FUNERAL RITE NOR MAN M MOURNING WEEDS
NO MOURNFUL BELL SHALL RING HER BURIAL
BUT THROW HER FORTH TO BEASTS AND BIRDS OF PREY
HER LIFE WAS BEASTLIKE AND DEVOID OF PITY
AND BEING SO SHALL HAVE LIKE WANT OF PITY 
SEE JUSTICE DONE ON AARON THAT DAMND MOOR
BY WHOM OUR HEAVY HAPS HAD THEIR BEGINNING
THEN AFTERWARDS TO ORDER WELL THE STATE
THAT LIKE EVENTS MAY NEER IT RUINATE
