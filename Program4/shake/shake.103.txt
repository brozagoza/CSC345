TO LIBERTY AND NOT TO BANISHMENT 
NOW MY COMATES AND BROTHERS IN EXILE
HATH NOT OLD CUSTOM MADE THIS LIFE MORE SWEET
THAN THAT OF PAINTED POMP ARE NOT THESE WOODS
MORE FREE FROM PERIL THAN THE ENVIOUS COURT
HERE FEEL WE BUT THE PENALTY OF ADAM
THE SEASONS DIFFERENCE AS THE ICY FANG
AND CHURLISH CHIDING OF THE WINTERS WIND
WHICH WHEN IT BITES AND BLOWS UPON MY BODY
EVEN TILL I SHRINK WITH COLD I SMILE AND SAY
THIS IS NO FLATTERY THESE ARE COUNSELLORS
THAT FEELINGLY PERSUADE ME WHAT I AM 
SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITY
WHICH LIKE THE TOAD UGLY AND VENOMOUS
WEARS YET A PRECIOUS JEWEL IN HIS HEAD
AND THIS OUR LIFE EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC HAUNT
FINDS TONGUES IN TREES BOOKS IN THE RUNNING BROOKS
SERMONS IN STONES AND GOOD IN EVERY THING 
I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT 
HAPPY IS YOUR GRACE
THAT CAN TRANSLATE THE STUBBORNNESS OF FORTUNE
INTO SO QUIET AND SO SWEET A STYLE 
COME SHALL WE GO AND KILL US VENISON
AND YET IT IRKS ME THE POOR DAPPLED FOOLS
BEING NATIVE BURGHERS OF THIS DESERT CITY
SHOULD IN THEIR OWN CONFINES WITH FORKED HEADS
HAVE THEIR ROUND HAUNCHES GORED 
INDEED MY LORD
THE MELANCHOLY JAQUES GRIEVES AT THAT
AND IN THAT KIND SWEARS YOU DO MORE USURP
THAN DOTH YOUR BROTHER THAT HATH BANISHD YOU 
TODAY MY LORD OF AMIENS AND MYSELF
DID STEAL BEHIND HIM AS HE LAY ALONG
UNDER AN OAK WHOSE ANTIQUE ROOT PEEPS OUT
UPON THE BROOK THAT BRAWLS ALONG THIS WOOD
TO THE WHICH PLACE A POOR SEQUESTERD STAG
THAT FROM THE HUNTERS AIM HAD TAEN A HURT
DID COME TO LANGUISH AND INDEED MY LORD
THE WRETCHED ANIMAL HEAVED FORTH SUCH GROANS
THAT THEIR DISCHARGE DID STRETCH HIS LEATHERN COAT
ALMOST TO BURSTING AND THE BIG ROUND TEARS
COURSED ONE ANOTHER DOWN HIS INNOCENT NOSE
IN PITEOUS CHASE AND THUS THE HAIRY FOOL
MUCH MARKED OF THE MELANCHOLY JAQUES
STOOD ON THE EXTREMEST VERGE OF THE SWIFT BROOK
AUGMENTING IT WITH TEARS 
BUT WHAT SAID JAQUES
DID HE NOT MORALIZE THIS SPECTACLE
O YES INTO A THOUSAND SIMILES 
FIRST FOR HIS WEEPING INTO THE NEEDLESS STREAM
POOR DEER QUOTH HE THOU MAKEST A TESTAMENT
AS WORLDLINGS DO GIVING THY SUM OF MORE
TO THAT WHICH HAD TOO MUCH THEN BEING THERE ALONE
LEFT AND ABANDOND OF HIS VELVET FRIENDS
TIS RIGHT QUOTH HE THUS MISERY DOTH PART
THE FLUX OF COMPANY ANON A CARELESS HERD
FULL OF THE PASTURE JUMPS ALONG BY HIM
AND NEVER STAYS TO GREET HIM AY QUOTH JAQUES
SWEEP ON YOU FAT AND GREASY CITIZENS
TIS JUST THE FASHION WHEREFORE DO YOU LOOK
UPON THAT POOR AND BROKEN BANKRUPT THERE
THUS MOST INVECTIVELY HE PIERCETH THROUGH
THE BODY OF THE COUNTRY CITY COURT
YEA AND OF THIS OUR LIFE SWEARING THAT WE

WHY WHO CRIES OUT ON PRIDE

WHO CAN COME IN AND SAY THAT I MEAN HER
WHEN SUCH A ONE AS SHE SUCH IS HER NEIGHBOUR
OR WHAT IS HE OF BASEST FUNCTION

THINKING THAT I MEAN HIM BUT THEREIN SUITS
HIS FOLLY TO THE METTLE OF MY SPEECH
THERE THEN HOW THEN WHAT THEN LET ME SEE WHEREIN

IN THE WHICH HOPE I BLUSH AND HIDE MY SWORD 
TRUE IS IT THAT WE HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS
AND HAVE WITH HOLY BELL BEEN KNOLLD TO CHURCH
AND SAT AT GOOD MENS FEASTS AND WIPED OUR EYES
OF DROPS THAT SACRED PITY HATH ENGENDERD

THIS WIDE AND UNIVERSAL THEATRE
PRESENTS MORE WOEFUL PAGEANTS THAN THE SCENE
WHEREIN WE PLAY IN 
ALL THE WORLDS A STAGE
AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY PLAYERS
THEY HAVE THEIR EXITS AND THEIR ENTRANCES
AND ONE MAN IN HIS TIME PLAYS MANY PARTS
HIS ACTS BEING SEVEN AGES  AT FIRST THE INFANT
MEWLING AND PUKING IN THE NURSES ARMS 
AND THEN THE WHINING SCHOOLBOY WITH HIS SATCHEL
AND SHINING MORNING FACE CREEPING LIKE SNAIL
UNWILLINGLY TO SCHOOL  AND THEN THE LOVER
SIGHING LIKE FURNACE WITH A WOEFUL BALLAD
MADE TO HIS MISTRESS EYEBROW  THEN A SOLDIER
FULL OF STRANGE OATHS AND BEARDED LIKE THE PARD
JEALOUS IN HONOUR SUDDEN AND QUICK IN QUARREL
SEEKING THE BUBBLE REPUTATION
EVEN IN THE CANNONS MOUTH  AND THEN THE JUSTICE
IN FAIR ROUND BELLY WITH GOOD CAPON LINED
WITH EYES SEVERE AND BEARD OF FORMAL CUT
FULL OF WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES
AND SO HE PLAYS HIS PART  THE SIXTH AGE SHIFTS
INTO THE LEAN AND SLIPPERD PANTALOON
WITH SPECTACLES ON NOSE AND POUCH ON SIDE
HIS YOUTHFUL HOSE WELL SAVED A WORLD TOO WIDE
FOR HIS SHRUNK SHANK AND HIS BIG MANLY VOICE
TURNING AGAIN TOWARD CHILDISH TREBLE PIPES
AND WHISTLES IN HIS SOUND  LAST SCENE OF ALL
THAT ENDS THIS STRANGE EVENTFUL HISTORY

DAY HE WRESTLED

I WILL CHIDE NO BREATHER IN THE WORLD BUT MYSELF
AGAINST WHOM I KNOW MOST FAULTS 
THE WORST FAULT YOU HAVE IS TO BE IN LOVE 
TIS A FAULT I WILL NOT CHANGE FOR YOUR BEST VIRTUE 
I AM WEARY OF YOU 
BY MY TROTH I WAS SEEKING FOR A FOOL WHEN I FOUND
YOU 
HE IS DROWNED IN THE BROOK LOOK BUT IN AND YOU
SHALL SEE HIM

WHICH I TAKE TO BE EITHER A FOOL OR A CIPHER 
ILL TARRY NO LONGER WITH YOU FAREWELL GOOD
SIGNIOR LOVE

LACKEY AND UNDER THAT HABIT PLAY THE KNAVE WITH HIM 
DO YOU HEAR FORESTER
VERY WELL WHAT WOULD YOU
I PRAY YOU WHAT IST OCLOCK
YOU SHOULD ASK ME WHAT TIME O DAY THERES NO CLOCK
IN THE FOREST 
THEN THERE IS NO TRUE LOVER IN THE FOREST ELSE
SIGHING EVERY MINUTE AND GROANING EVERY HOUR WOULD
DETECT THE LAZY FOOT OF TIME AS WELL AS A CLOCK 
AND WHY NOT THE SWIFT FOOT OF TIME HAD NOT THAT
BEEN AS PROPER
BY NO MEANS SIR TIME TRAVELS IN DIVERS PACES WITH
DIVERS PERSONS  ILL TELL YOU WHO TIME AMBLES
WITHAL WHO TIME TROTS WITHAL WHO TIME GALLOPS

I PRITHEE WHO DOTH HE TROT WITHAL
MARRY HE TROTS HARD WITH A YOUNG MAID BETWEEN THE
CONTRACT OF HER MARRIAGE AND THE DAY IT IS
SOLEMNIZED IF THE INTERIM BE BUT A SENNIGHT
TIMES PACE IS SO HARD THAT IT SEEMS THE LENGTH OF
SEVEN YEAR 
WHO AMBLES TIME WITHAL
WITH A PRIEST THAT LACKS LATIN AND A RICH MAN THAT
HATH NOT THE GOUT FOR THE ONE SLEEPS EASILY BECAUSE
HE CANNOT STUDY AND THE OTHER LIVES MERRILY BECAUSE
HE FEELS NO PAIN THE ONE LACKING THE BURDEN OF LEAN
AND WASTEFUL LEARNING THE OTHER KNOWING NO BURDEN
OF HEAVY TEDIOUS PENURY THESE TIME AMBLES WITHAL 
WHO DOTH HE GALLOP WITHAL
WITH A THIEF TO THE GALLOWS FOR THOUGH HE GO AS
SOFTLY AS FOOT CAN FALL HE THINKS HIMSELF TOO SOON THERE 
WHO STAYS IT STILL WITHAL
WITH LAWYERS IN THE VACATION FOR THEY SLEEP BETWEEN
TERM AND TERM AND THEN THEY PERCEIVE NOT HOW TIME MOVES 
WHERE DWELL YOU PRETTY YOUTH
WITH THIS SHEPHERDESS MY SISTER HERE IN THE
SKIRTS OF THE FOREST LIKE FRINGE UPON A PETTICOAT 
ARE YOU NATIVE OF THIS PLACE
AS THE CONY THAT YOU SEE DWELL WHERE SHE IS KINDLED 
YOUR ACCENT IS SOMETHING FINER THAN YOU COULD
PURCHASE IN SO REMOVED A DWELLING 
I HAVE BEEN TOLD SO OF MANY BUT INDEED AN OLD
RELIGIOUS UNCLE OF MINE TAUGHT ME TO SPEAK WHO WAS
IN HIS YOUTH AN INLAND MAN ONE THAT KNEW COURTSHIP
TOO WELL FOR THERE HE FELL IN LOVE  I HAVE HEARD
HIM READ MANY LECTURES AGAINST IT AND I THANK GOD
I AM NOT A WOMAN TO BE TOUCHED WITH SO MANY
GIDDY OFFENCES AS HE HATH GENERALLY TAXED THEIR
WHOLE SEX WITHAL 
CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE PRINCIPAL EVILS THAT HE
LAID TO THE CHARGE OF WOMEN
THERE WERE NONE PRINCIPAL THEY WERE ALL LIKE ONE
ANOTHER AS HALFPENCE ARE EVERY ONE FAULT SEEMING
MONSTROUS TILL HIS FELLOW FAULT CAME TO MATCH IT 
I PRITHEE RECOUNT SOME OF THEM 
NO I WILL NOT CAST AWAY MY PHYSIC BUT ON THOSE THAT
ARE SICK  THERE IS A MAN HAUNTS THE FOREST THAT
ABUSES OUR YOUNG PLANTS WITH CARVING ROSALIND ON
THEIR BARKS HANGS ODES UPON HAWTHORNS AND ELEGIES
ON BRAMBLES ALL FORSOOTH DEIFYING THE NAME OF
ROSALIND IF I COULD MEET THAT FANCYMONGER I WOULD
GIVE HIM SOME GOOD COUNSEL FOR HE SEEMS TO HAVE THE
QUOTIDIAN OF LOVE UPON HIM 
I AM HE THAT IS SO LOVESHAKED I PRAY YOU TELL ME
YOUR REMEDY 
THERE IS NONE OF MY UNCLES MARKS UPON YOU HE
TAUGHT ME HOW TO KNOW A MAN IN LOVE IN WHICH CAGE
OF RUSHES I AM SURE YOU ARE NOT PRISONER 
WHAT WERE HIS MARKS
A LEAN CHEEK WHICH YOU HAVE NOT A BLUE EYE AND
SUNKEN WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AN UNQUESTIONABLE
SPIRIT WHICH YOU HAVE NOT A BEARD NEGLECTED
WHICH YOU HAVE NOT BUT I PARDON YOU FOR THAT FOR
SIMPLY YOUR HAVING IN BEARD IS A YOUNGER BROTHERS
REVENUE THEN YOUR HOSE SHOULD BE UNGARTERED YOUR
BONNET UNBANDED YOUR SLEEVE UNBUTTONED YOUR SHOE
UNTIED AND EVERY THING ABOUT YOU DEMONSTRATING A
CARELESS DESOLATION BUT YOU ARE NO SUCH MAN YOU
ARE RATHER POINTDEVICE IN YOUR ACCOUTREMENTS AS
LOVING YOURSELF THAN SEEMING THE LOVER OF ANY OTHER 
FAIR YOUTH I WOULD I COULD MAKE THEE BELIEVE I LOVE 
ME BELIEVE IT  YOU MAY AS SOON MAKE HER THAT YOU
LOVE BELIEVE IT WHICH I WARRANT SHE IS APTER TO
DO THAN TO CONFESS SHE DOES THAT IS ONE OF THE
POINTS IN THE WHICH WOMEN STILL GIVE THE LIE TO
THEIR CONSCIENCES  BUT IN GOOD SOOTH ARE YOU HE

IS SO ADMIRED
I SWEAR TO THEE YOUTH BY THE WHITE HAND OF
ROSALIND I AM THAT HE THAT UNFORTUNATE HE 
BUT ARE YOU SO MUCH IN LOVE AS YOUR RHYMES SPEAK
NEITHER RHYME NOR REASON CAN EXPRESS HOW MUCH 
LOVE IS MERELY A MADNESS AND I TELL YOU DESERVES
AS WELL A DARK HOUSE AND A WHIP AS MADMEN DO AND
THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT SO PUNISHED AND CURED
IS THAT THE LUNACY IS SO ORDINARY THAT THE WHIPPERS
ARE IN LOVE TOO  YET I PROFESS CURING IT BY COUNSEL 
DID YOU EVER CURE ANY SO
YES ONE AND IN THIS MANNER  HE WAS TO IMAGINE ME
HIS LOVE HIS MISTRESS AND I SET HIM EVERY DAY TO

CATTLE OF THIS COLOUR WOULD NOW LIKE HIM NOW LOATHE

FOR HIM THEN SPIT AT HIM THAT I DRAVE MY SUITOR
FROM HIS MAD HUMOUR OF LOVE TO A LIVING HUMOUR OF
MADNESS WHICH WAS TO FORSWEAR THE FULL STREAM OF
THE WORLD AND TO LIVE IN A NOOK MERELY MONASTIC 
AND THUS I CURED HIM AND THIS WAY WILL I TAKE UPON
ME TO WASH YOUR LIVER AS CLEAN AS A SOUND SHEEPS

THERE WAS NOT ANY MAN DIED IN HIS OWN PERSON
VIDELICIT IN A LOVECAUSE  TROILUS HAD HIS BRAINS
DASHED OUT WITH A GRECIAN CLUB YET HE DID WHAT HE
COULD TO DIE BEFORE AND HE IS ONE OF THE PATTERNS
OF LOVE  LEANDER HE WOULD HAVE LIVED MANY A FAIR
YEAR THOUGH HERO HAD TURNED NUN IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
FOR A HOT MIDSUMMER NIGHT FOR GOOD YOUTH HE WENT
BUT FORTH TO WASH HIM IN THE HELLESPONT AND BEING
TAKEN WITH THE CRAMP WAS DROWNED AND THE FOOLISH
CORONERS OF THAT AGE FOUND IT WAS HERO OF SESTOS 
BUT THESE ARE ALL LIES MEN HAVE DIED FROM TIME TO
TIME AND WORMS HAVE EATEN THEM BUT NOT FOR LOVE 
I WOULD NOT HAVE MY RIGHT ROSALIND OF THIS MIND
FOR I PROTEST HER FROWN MIGHT KILL ME 
BY THIS HAND IT WILL NOT KILL A FLY  BUT COME NOW
I WILL BE YOUR ROSALIND IN A MORE COMINGON
DISPOSITION AND ASK ME WHAT YOU WILL  I WILL GRANT

I MIGHT ASK YOU FOR YOUR COMMISSION BUT I DO TAKE
THEE ORLANDO FOR MY HUSBAND THERES A GIRL GOES

MORE CLAMOROUS THAN A PARROT AGAINST RAIN MORE
NEWFANGLED THAN AN APE MORE GIDDY IN MY DESIRES

IN THE FOUNTAIN AND I WILL DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE
DISPOSED TO BE MERRY I WILL LAUGH LIKE A HYEN AND
THAT WHEN THOU ART INCLINED TO SLEEP 
BUT WILL MY ROSALIND DO SO

WISER THE WAYWARDER MAKE THE DOORS UPON A WOMANS

GOOD MORROW FAIR ONES PRAY YOU IF YOU KNOW

THIS HANDKERCHER WAS STAIND 
I PRAY YOU TELL IT 
WHEN LAST THE YOUNG ORLANDO PARTED FROM YOU
HE LEFT A PROMISE TO RETURN AGAIN
WITHIN AN HOUR AND PACING THROUGH THE FOREST
CHEWING THE FOOD OF SWEET AND BITTER FANCY
LO WHAT BEFELL  HE THREW HIS EYE ASIDE
AND MARK WHAT OBJECT DID PRESENT ITSELF
UNDER AN OAK WHOSE BOUGHS WERE MOSSD WITH AGE
AND HIGH TOP BALD WITH DRY ANTIQUITY
A WRETCHED RAGGED MAN OERGROWN WITH HAIR
LAY SLEEPING ON HIS BACK ABOUT HIS NECK
A GREEN AND GILDED SNAKE HAD WREATHED ITSELF
WHO WITH HER HEAD NIMBLE IN THREATS APPROACHD
THE OPENING OF HIS MOUTH BUT SUDDENLY
SEEING ORLANDO IT UNLINKD ITSELF
AND WITH INDENTED GLIDES DID SLIP AWAY
INTO A BUSH UNDER WHICH BUSHS SHADE
A LIONESS WITH UDDERS ALL DRAWN DRY
LAY COUCHING HEAD ON GROUND WITH CATLIKE WATCH
WHEN THAT THE SLEEPING MAN SHOULD STIR FOR TIS
THE ROYAL DISPOSITION OF THAT BEAST
TO PREY ON NOTHING THAT DOTH SEEM AS DEAD
THIS SEEN ORLANDO DID APPROACH THE MAN
AND FOUND IT WAS HIS BROTHER HIS ELDER BROTHER 
O I HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAK OF THAT SAME BROTHER
AND HE DID RENDER HIM THE MOST UNNATURAL
THAT LIVED AMONGST MEN 
AND WELL HE MIGHT SO DO
FOR WELL I KNOW HE WAS UNNATURAL 
BUT TO ORLANDO DID HE LEAVE HIM THERE
FOOD TO THE SUCKD AND HUNGRY LIONESS
TWICE DID HE TURN HIS BACK AND PURPOSED SO
BUT KINDNESS NOBLER EVER THAN REVENGE
AND NATURE STRONGER THAN HIS JUST OCCASION
MADE HIM GIVE BATTLE TO THE LIONESS
WHO QUICKLY FELL BEFORE HIM IN WHICH HURTLING
FROM MISERABLE SLUMBER I AWAKED 
ARE YOU HIS BROTHER
WAST YOU HE RESCUED
WAST YOU THAT DID SO OFT CONTRIVE TO KILL HIM
TWAS I BUT TIS NOT I I DO NOT SHAME

THE LIONESS HAD TORN SOME FLESH AWAY
WHICH ALL THIS WHILE HAD BLED AND NOW HE FAINTED
