IN SOOTH I KNOW NOT WHY I AM SO SAD
IT WEARIES ME YOU SAY IT WEARIES YOU
BUT HOW I CAUGHT IT FOUND IT OR CAME BY IT
WHAT STUFF TIS MADE OF WHEREOF IT IS BORN
I AM TO LEARN
AND SUCH A WANTWIT SADNESS MAKES OF ME
THAT I HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW MYSELF 
YOUR MIND IS TOSSING ON THE OCEAN
THERE WHERE YOUR ARGOSIES WITH PORTLY SAIL
LIKE SIGNIORS AND RICH BURGHERS ON THE FLOOD
OR AS IT WERE THE PAGEANTS OF THE SEA
DO OVERPEER THE PETTY TRAFFICKERS
THAT CURTSY TO THEM DO THEM REVERENCE
AS THEY FLY BY THEM WITH THEIR WOVEN WINGS 
BELIEVE ME SIR HAD I SUCH VENTURE FORTH
THE BETTER PART OF MY AFFECTIONS WOULD
BE WITH MY HOPES ABROAD  I SHOULD BE STILL
PLUCKING THE GRASS TO KNOW WHERE SITS THE WIND
PEERING IN MAPS FOR PORTS AND PIERS AND ROADS
AND EVERY OBJECT THAT MIGHT MAKE ME FEAR
MISFORTUNE TO MY VENTURES OUT OF DOUBT
WOULD MAKE ME SAD 
MY WIND COOLING MY BROTH
WOULD BLOW ME TO AN AGUE WHEN I THOUGHT
WHAT HARM A WIND TOO GREAT AT SEA MIGHT DO 
I SHOULD NOT SEE THE SANDY HOURGLASS RUN
BUT I SHOULD THINK OF SHALLOWS AND OF FLATS
AND SEE MY WEALTHY ANDREW DOCKD IN SAND
VAILING HER HIGHTOP LOWER THAN HER RIBS
TO KISS HER BURIAL  SHOULD I GO TO CHURCH
AND SEE THE HOLY EDIFICE OF STONE
AND NOT BETHINK ME STRAIGHT OF DANGEROUS ROCKS
WHICH TOUCHING BUT MY GENTLE VESSELS SIDE
WOULD SCATTER ALL HER SPICES ON THE STREAM
ENROBE THE ROARING WATERS WITH MY SILKS
AND IN A WORD BUT EVEN NOW WORTH THIS
AND NOW WORTH NOTHING SHALL I HAVE THE THOUGHT
TO THINK ON THIS AND SHALL I LACK THE THOUGHT
THAT SUCH A THING BECHANCED WOULD MAKE ME SAD
BUT TELL NOT ME I KNOW ANTONIO
IS SAD TO THINK UPON HIS MERCHANDISE 
BELIEVE ME NO I THANK MY FORTUNE FOR IT
MY VENTURES ARE NOT IN ONE BOTTOM TRUSTED
NOR TO ONE PLACE NOR IS MY WHOLE ESTATE
UPON THE FORTUNE OF THIS PRESENT YEAR
THEREFORE MY MERCHANDISE MAKES ME NOT SAD 
WHY THEN YOU ARE IN LOVE 
FIE FIE 
NOT IN LOVE NEITHER THEN LET US SAY YOU ARE SAD
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT MERRY AND TWERE AS EASY
FOR YOU TO LAUGH AND LEAP AND SAY YOU ARE MERRY
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT SAD  NOW BY TWOHEADED JANUS
NATURE HATH FRAMED STRANGE FELLOWS IN HER TIME
SOME THAT WILL EVERMORE PEEP THROUGH THEIR EYES
AND LAUGH LIKE PARROTS AT A BAGPIPER
AND OTHER OF SUCH VINEGAR ASPECT
THAT THEYLL NOT SHOW THEIR TEETH IN WAY OF SMILE
THOUGH NESTOR SWEAR THE JEST BE LAUGHABLE 
HERE COMES BASSANIO YOUR MOST NOBLE KINSMAN
GRATIANO AND LORENZO  FARE YE WELL
WE LEAVE YOU NOW WITH BETTER COMPANY 
I WOULD HAVE STAYD TILL I HAD MADE YOU MERRY
IF WORTHIER FRIENDS HAD NOT PREVENTED ME 
YOUR WORTH IS VERY DEAR IN MY REGARD 
I TAKE IT YOUR OWN BUSINESS CALLS ON YOU
AND YOU EMBRACE THE OCCASION TO DEPART 
GOOD MORROW MY GOOD LORDS 
GOOD SIGNIORS BOTH WHEN SHALL WE LAUGH SAY WHEN
YOU GROW EXCEEDING STRANGE MUST IT BE SO
WELL MAKE OUR LEISURES TO ATTEND ON YOURS 
MY LORD BASSANIO SINCE YOU HAVE FOUND ANTONIO
WE TWO WILL LEAVE YOU BUT AT DINNERTIME
I PRAY YOU HAVE IN MIND WHERE WE MUST MEET 
I WILL NOT FAIL YOU 
YOU LOOK NOT WELL SIGNIOR ANTONIO
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT UPON THE WORLD
THEY LOSE IT THAT DO BUY IT WITH MUCH CARE
BELIEVE ME YOU ARE MARVELLOUSLY CHANGED 
I HOLD THE WORLD BUT AS THE WORLD GRATIANO
A STAGE WHERE EVERY MAN MUST PLAY A PART
AND MINE A SAD ONE 
LET ME PLAY THE FOOL
WITH MIRTH AND LAUGHTER LET OLD WRINKLES COME
AND LET MY LIVER RATHER HEAT WITH WINE
THAN MY HEART COOL WITH MORTIFYING GROANS 
WHY SHOULD A MAN WHOSE BLOOD IS WARM WITHIN
SIT LIKE HIS GRANDSIRE CUT IN ALABASTER
SLEEP WHEN HE WAKES AND CREEP INTO THE JAUNDICE
BY BEING PEEVISH I TELL THEE WHAT ANTONIO 
I LOVE THEE AND IT IS MY LOVE THAT SPEAKS 
THERE ARE A SORT OF MEN WHOSE VISAGES
DO CREAM AND MANTLE LIKE A STANDING POND
AND DO A WILFUL STILLNESS ENTERTAIN
WITH PURPOSE TO BE DRESSD IN AN OPINION
OF WISDOM GRAVITY PROFOUND CONCEIT
AS WHO SHOULD SAY I AM SIR ORACLE
AND WHEN I OPE MY LIPS LET NO DOG BARK 
O MY ANTONIO I DO KNOW OF THESE
THAT THEREFORE ONLY ARE REPUTED WISE
FOR SAYING NOTHING WHEN I AM VERY SURE
IF THEY SHOULD SPEAK WOULD ALMOST DAMN THOSE EARS
WHICH HEARING THEM WOULD CALL THEIR BROTHERS FOOLS 
ILL TELL THEE MORE OF THIS ANOTHER TIME
BUT FISH NOT WITH THIS MELANCHOLY BAIT
FOR THIS FOOL GUDGEON THIS OPINION 
COME GOOD LORENZO  FARE YE WELL AWHILE
ILL END MY EXHORTATION AFTER DINNER 
WELL WE WILL LEAVE YOU THEN TILL DINNERTIME
I MUST BE ONE OF THESE SAME DUMB WISE MEN
FOR GRATIANO NEVER LETS ME SPEAK 
WELL KEEP ME COMPANY BUT TWO YEARS MOE
THOU SHALT NOT KNOW THE SOUND OF THINE OWN TONGUE 
FAREWELL ILL GROW A TALKER FOR THIS GEAR 
THANKS I FAITH FOR SILENCE IS ONLY COMMENDABLE
IN A NEATS TONGUE DRIED AND A MAID NOT VENDIBLE 
IS THAT ANY THING NOW
GRATIANO SPEAKS AN INFINITE DEAL OF NOTHING MORE
THAN ANY MAN IN ALL VENICE  HIS REASONS ARE AS TWO
GRAINS OF WHEAT HID IN TWO BUSHELS OF CHAFF YOU
SHALL SEEK ALL DAY ERE YOU FIND THEM AND WHEN YOU
HAVE THEM THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE SEARCH 
WELL TELL ME NOW WHAT LADY IS THE SAME
TO WHOM YOU SWORE A SECRET PILGRIMAGE
THAT YOU TODAY PROMISED TO TELL ME OF
TIS NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU ANTONIO
HOW MUCH I HAVE DISABLED MINE ESTATE
BY SOMETHING SHOWING A MORE SWELLING PORT
THAN MY FAINT MEANS WOULD GRANT CONTINUANCE
NOR DO I NOW MAKE MOAN TO BE ABRIDGED
FROM SUCH A NOBLE RATE BUT MY CHIEF CARE
IS TO COME FAIRLY OFF FROM THE GREAT DEBTS
WHEREIN MY TIME SOMETHING TOO PRODIGAL
HATH LEFT ME GAGED  TO YOU ANTONIO
I OWE THE MOST IN MONEY AND IN LOVE
AND FROM YOUR LOVE I HAVE A WARRANTY
TO UNBURDEN ALL MY PLOTS AND PURPOSES
HOW TO GET CLEAR OF ALL THE DEBTS I OWE 
I PRAY YOU GOOD BASSANIO LET ME KNOW IT
AND IF IT STAND AS YOU YOURSELF STILL DO
WITHIN THE EYE OF HONOUR BE ASSURED
MY PURSE MY PERSON MY EXTREMEST MEANS
LIE ALL UNLOCKD TO YOUR OCCASIONS 
IN MY SCHOOLDAYS WHEN I HAD LOST ONE SHAFT
I SHOT HIS FELLOW OF THE SELFSAME FLIGHT
THE SELFSAME WAY WITH MORE ADVISED WATCH
TO FIND THE OTHER FORTH AND BY ADVENTURING BOTH
I OFT FOUND BOTH I URGE THIS CHILDHOOD PROOF
BECAUSE WHAT FOLLOWS IS PURE INNOCENCE 
I OWE YOU MUCH AND LIKE A WILFUL YOUTH
THAT WHICH I OWE IS LOST BUT IF YOU PLEASE
TO SHOOT ANOTHER ARROW THAT SELF WAY
WHICH YOU DID SHOOT THE FIRST I DO NOT DOUBT
AS I WILL WATCH THE AIM OR TO FIND BOTH
OR BRING YOUR LATTER HAZARD BACK AGAIN
AND THANKFULLY REST DEBTOR FOR THE FIRST 
YOU KNOW ME WELL AND HEREIN SPEND BUT TIME
TO WIND ABOUT MY LOVE WITH CIRCUMSTANCE
AND OUT OF DOUBT YOU DO ME NOW MORE WRONG
IN MAKING QUESTION OF MY UTTERMOST
THAN IF YOU HAD MADE WASTE OF ALL I HAVE
THEN DO BUT SAY TO ME WHAT I SHOULD DO
THAT IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE MAY BY ME BE DONE
AND I AM PREST UNTO IT THEREFORE SPEAK 
IN BELMONT IS A LADY RICHLY LEFT
AND SHE IS FAIR AND FAIRER THAN THAT WORD
OF WONDROUS VIRTUES SOMETIMES FROM HER EYES
I DID RECEIVE FAIR SPEECHLESS MESSAGES
HER NAME IS PORTIA NOTHING UNDERVALUED
TO CATOS DAUGHTER BRUTUS PORTIA
NOR IS THE WIDE WORLD IGNORANT OF HER WORTH
FOR THE FOUR WINDS BLOW IN FROM EVERY COAST
RENOWNED SUITORS AND HER SUNNY LOCKS
HANG ON HER TEMPLES LIKE A GOLDEN FLEECE
WHICH MAKES HER SEAT OF BELMONT COLCHOS STRAND
AND MANY JASONS COME IN QUEST OF HER 
O MY ANTONIO HAD I BUT THE MEANS
TO HOLD A RIVAL PLACE WITH ONE OF THEM
I HAVE A MIND PRESAGES ME SUCH THRIFT
THAT I SHOULD QUESTIONLESS BE FORTUNATE 
THOU KNOWST THAT ALL MY FORTUNES ARE AT SEA
NEITHER HAVE I MONEY NOR COMMODITY
TO RAISE A PRESENT SUM THEREFORE GO FORTH
TRY WHAT MY CREDIT CAN IN VENICE DO
THAT SHALL BE RACKD EVEN TO THE UTTERMOST
TO FURNISH THEE TO BELMONT TO FAIR PORTIA 
GO PRESENTLY INQUIRE AND SO WILL I
WHERE MONEY IS AND I NO QUESTION MAKE
TO HAVE IT OF MY TRUST OR FOR MY SAKE 
BY MY TROTH NERISSA MY LITTLE BODY IS AWEARY OF
THIS GREAT WORLD 
YOU WOULD BE SWEET MADAM IF YOUR MISERIES WERE IN
THE SAME ABUNDANCE AS YOUR GOOD FORTUNES ARE AND
YET FOR AUGHT I SEE THEY ARE AS SICK THAT SURFEIT
WITH TOO MUCH AS THEY THAT STARVE WITH NOTHING  IT
IS NO MEAN HAPPINESS THEREFORE TO BE SEATED IN THE
MEAN SUPERFLUITY COMES SOONER BY WHITE HAIRS BUT
COMPETENCY LIVES LONGER 
GOOD SENTENCES AND WELL PRONOUNCED 
THEY WOULD BE BETTER IF WELL FOLLOWED 
IF TO DO WERE AS EASY AS TO KNOW WHAT WERE GOOD TO
DO CHAPELS HAD BEEN CHURCHES AND POOR MENS
COTTAGES PRINCES PALACES  IT IS A GOOD DIVINE THAT
FOLLOWS HIS OWN INSTRUCTIONS I CAN EASIER TEACH
TWENTY WHAT WERE GOOD TO BE DONE THAN BE ONE OF THE
TWENTY TO FOLLOW MINE OWN TEACHING  THE BRAIN MAY
DEVISE LAWS FOR THE BLOOD BUT A HOT TEMPER LEAPS
OER A COLD DECREE SUCH A HARE IS MADNESS THE
YOUTH TO SKIP OER THE MESHES OF GOOD COUNSEL THE
CRIPPLE  BUT THIS REASONING IS NOT IN THE FASHION TO
CHOOSE ME A HUSBAND  O ME THE WORD CHOOSE  I MAY
NEITHER CHOOSE WHOM I WOULD NOR REFUSE WHOM I
DISLIKE SO IS THE WILL OF A LIVING DAUGHTER CURBED
BY THE WILL OF A DEAD FATHER  IS IT NOT HARD
NERISSA THAT I CANNOT CHOOSE ONE NOR REFUSE NONE
YOUR FATHER WAS EVER VIRTUOUS AND HOLY MEN AT THEIR
DEATH HAVE GOOD INSPIRATIONS THEREFORE THE LOTTERY
THAT HE HATH DEVISED IN THESE THREE CHESTS OF GOLD
SILVER AND LEAD WHEREOF WHO CHOOSES HIS MEANING
CHOOSES YOU WILL NO DOUBT NEVER BE CHOSEN BY ANY
RIGHTLY BUT ONE WHO SHALL RIGHTLY LOVE  BUT WHAT
WARMTH IS THERE IN YOUR AFFECTION TOWARDS ANY OF
THESE PRINCELY SUITORS THAT ARE ALREADY COME
I PRAY THEE OVERNAME THEM AND AS THOU NAMEST
THEM I WILL DESCRIBE THEM AND ACCORDING TO MY
DESCRIPTION LEVEL AT MY AFFECTION 
FIRST THERE IS THE NEAPOLITAN PRINCE 
AY THATS A COLT INDEED FOR HE DOTH NOTHING BUT
TALK OF HIS HORSE AND HE MAKES IT A GREAT
APPROPRIATION TO HIS OWN GOOD PARTS THAT HE CAN
SHOE HIM HIMSELF  I AM MUCH AFEARD MY LADY HIS
MOTHER PLAYED FALSE WITH A SMITH 
THEN THERE IS THE COUNTY PALATINE 
HE DOTH NOTHING BUT FROWN AS WHO SHOULD SAY IF YOU
WILL NOT HAVE ME CHOOSE HE HEARS MERRY TALES AND
SMILES NOT I FEAR HE WILL PROVE THE WEEPING
PHILOSOPHER WHEN HE GROWS OLD BEING SO FULL OF
UNMANNERLY SADNESS IN HIS YOUTH  I HAD RATHER BE
MARRIED TO A DEATHSHEAD WITH A BONE IN HIS MOUTH
THAN TO EITHER OF THESE  GOD DEFEND ME FROM THESE
TWO 
HOW SAY YOU BY THE FRENCH LORD MONSIEUR LE BON
GOD MADE HIM AND THEREFORE LET HIM PASS FOR A MAN 
IN TRUTH I KNOW IT IS A SIN TO BE A MOCKER BUT
HE  WHY HE HATH A HORSE BETTER THAN THE
NEAPOLITANS A BETTER BAD HABIT OF FROWNING THAN
THE COUNT PALATINE HE IS EVERY MAN IN NO MAN IF A
THROSTLE SING HE FALLS STRAIGHT A CAPERING HE WILL
FENCE WITH HIS OWN SHADOW IF I SHOULD MARRY HIM I
SHOULD MARRY TWENTY HUSBANDS  IF HE WOULD DESPISE ME
I WOULD FORGIVE HIM FOR IF HE LOVE ME TO MADNESS I
SHALL NEVER REQUITE HIM 
WHAT SAY YOU THEN TO FALCONBRIDGE THE YOUNG BARON
OF ENGLAND
YOU KNOW I SAY NOTHING TO HIM FOR HE UNDERSTANDS
NOT ME NOR I HIM HE HATH NEITHER LATIN FRENCH
NOR ITALIAN AND YOU WILL COME INTO THE COURT AND
SWEAR THAT I HAVE A POOR PENNYWORTH IN THE ENGLISH 
HE IS A PROPER MANS PICTURE BUT ALAS WHO CAN
CONVERSE WITH A DUMBSHOW HOW ODDLY HE IS SUITED 
I THINK HE BOUGHT HIS DOUBLET IN ITALY HIS ROUND
HOSE IN FRANCE HIS BONNET IN GERMANY AND HIS
BEHAVIOR EVERY WHERE 
WHAT THINK YOU OF THE SCOTTISH LORD HIS NEIGHBOUR
THAT HE HATH A NEIGHBOURLY CHARITY IN HIM FOR HE
BORROWED A BOX OF THE EAR OF THE ENGLISHMAN AND
SWORE HE WOULD PAY HIM AGAIN WHEN HE WAS ABLE I
THINK THE FRENCHMAN BECAME HIS SURETY AND SEALED
UNDER FOR ANOTHER 
HOW LIKE YOU THE YOUNG GERMAN THE DUKE OF SAXONYS NEPHEW
VERY VILELY IN THE MORNING WHEN HE IS SOBER AND
MOST VILELY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HE IS DRUNK WHEN
HE IS BEST HE IS A LITTLE WORSE THAN A MAN AND
WHEN HE IS WORST HE IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A BEAST
AND THE WORST FALL THAT EVER FELL I HOPE I SHALL
MAKE SHIFT TO GO WITHOUT HIM 
IF HE SHOULD OFFER TO CHOOSE AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT
CASKET YOU SHOULD REFUSE TO PERFORM YOUR FATHERS
WILL IF YOU SHOULD REFUSE TO ACCEPT HIM 
THEREFORE FOR FEAR OF THE WORST I PRAY THEE SET A
DEEP GLASS OF RHENISH WINE ON THE CONTRARY CASKET
FOR IF THE DEVIL BE WITHIN AND THAT TEMPTATION
WITHOUT I KNOW HE WILL CHOOSE IT  I WILL DO ANY
THING NERISSA ERE ILL BE MARRIED TO A SPONGE 
YOU NEED NOT FEAR LADY THE HAVING ANY OF THESE
LORDS THEY HAVE ACQUAINTED ME WITH THEIR
DETERMINATIONS WHICH IS INDEED TO RETURN TO THEIR
HOME AND TO TROUBLE YOU WITH NO MORE SUIT UNLESS
YOU MAY BE WON BY SOME OTHER SORT THAN YOUR FATHERS
IMPOSITION DEPENDING ON THE CASKETS 
IF I LIVE TO BE AS OLD AS SIBYLLA I WILL DIE AS
CHASTE AS DIANA UNLESS I BE OBTAINED BY THE MANNER
OF MY FATHERS WILL  I AM GLAD THIS PARCEL OF WOOERS
ARE SO REASONABLE FOR THERE IS NOT ONE AMONG THEM
BUT I DOTE ON HIS VERY ABSENCE AND I PRAY GOD GRANT
THEM A FAIR DEPARTURE 
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER LADY IN YOUR FATHERS TIME A
VENETIAN A SCHOLAR AND A SOLDIER THAT CAME HITHER
IN COMPANY OF THE MARQUIS OF MONTFERRAT
YES YES IT WAS BASSANIO AS I THINK HE WAS SO CALLED 
TRUE MADAM HE OF ALL THE MEN THAT EVER MY FOOLISH
EYES LOOKED UPON WAS THE BEST DESERVING A FAIR LADY 
I REMEMBER HIM WELL AND I REMEMBER HIM WORTHY OF
THY PRAISE 
HOW NOW  WHAT NEWS
THE FOUR STRANGERS SEEK FOR YOU MADAM TO TAKE
THEIR LEAVE AND THERE IS A FORERUNNER COME FROM A
FIFTH THE PRINCE OF MOROCCO WHO BRINGS WORD THE
PRINCE HIS MASTER WILL BE HERE TONIGHT 
IF I COULD BID THE FIFTH WELCOME WITH SO GOOD A
HEART AS I CAN BID THE OTHER FOUR FAREWELL I SHOULD
BE GLAD OF HIS APPROACH IF HE HAVE THE CONDITION
OF A SAINT AND THE COMPLEXION OF A DEVIL I HAD
RATHER HE SHOULD SHRIVE ME THAN WIVE ME  COME

HATH AN ARGOSY BOUND TO TRIPOLIS ANOTHER TO THE
INDIES I UNDERSTAND MOREOVER UPON THE RIALTO HE

A GOLDEN MIND STOOPS NOT TO SHOWS OF DROSS

WHAT SAYS THE SILVER WITH HER VIRGIN HUE
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GET AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES 
AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES  PAUSE THERE MOROCCO
AND WEIGH THY VALUE WITH AN EVEN HAND
IF THOU BEST RATED BY THY ESTIMATION
THOU DOST DESERVE ENOUGH AND YET ENOUGH

AND YET TO BE AFEARD OF MY DESERVING
WERE BUT A WEAK DISABLING OF MYSELF 
AS MUCH AS I DESERVE  WHY THATS THE LADY
I DO IN BIRTH DESERVE HER AND IN FORTUNES
IN GRACES AND IN QUALITIES OF BREEDING
BUT MORE THAN THESE IN LOVE I DO DESERVE 
WHAT IF I STRAYD NO FURTHER BUT CHOSE HERE
LETS SEE ONCE MORE THIS SAYING GRAVED IN GOLD
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GAIN WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE 
WHY THATS THE LADY ALL THE WORLD DESIRES HER
FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH THEY COME
TO KISS THIS SHRINE THIS MORTALBREATHING SAINT
THE HYRCANIAN DESERTS AND THE VASTY WILDS
OF WIDE ARABIA ARE AS THOROUGHFARES NOW
FOR PRINCES TO COME VIEW FAIR PORTIA
THE WATERY KINGDOM WHOSE AMBITIOUS HEAD
SPITS IN THE FACE OF HEAVEN IS NO BAR
TO STOP THE FOREIGN SPIRITS BUT THEY COME
AS OER A BROOK TO SEE FAIR PORTIA 
ONE OF THESE THREE CONTAINS HER HEAVENLY PICTURE 
IST LIKE THAT LEAD CONTAINS HER TWERE DAMNATION
TO THINK SO BASE A THOUGHT IT WERE TOO GROSS
TO RIB HER CERECLOTH IN THE OBSCURE GRAVE 
OR SHALL I THINK IN SILVER SHES IMMURED
BEING TEN TIMES UNDERVALUED TO TRIED GOLD
O SINFUL THOUGHT  NEVER SO RICH A GEM
WAS SET IN WORSE THAN GOLD  THEY HAVE IN ENGLAND
A COIN THAT BEARS THE FIGURE OF AN ANGEL
STAMPED IN GOLD BUT THATS INSCULPD UPON
BUT HERE AN ANGEL IN A GOLDEN BED
LIES ALL WITHIN  DELIVER ME THE KEY
HERE DO I CHOOSE AND THRIVE I AS I MAY 
THERE TAKE IT PRINCE AND IF MY FORM LIE THERE

O HELL  WHAT HAVE WE HERE
A CARRION DEATH WITHIN WHOSE EMPTY EYE

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD
OFTEN HAVE YOU HEARD THAT TOLD
MANY A MAN HIS LIFE HATH SOLD
BUT MY OUTSIDE TO BEHOLD
GILDED TOMBS DO WORMS ENFOLD 
HAD YOU BEEN AS WISE AS BOLD
YOUNG IN LIMBS IN JUDGMENT OLD
YOUR ANSWER HAD NOT BEEN INSCROLLD
FARE YOU WELL YOUR SUIT IS COLD 
COLD INDEED AND LABOUR LOST
THEN FAREWELL HEAT AND WELCOME FROST 
PORTIA ADIEU  I HAVE TOO GRIEVED A HEART
TO TAKE A TEDIOUS LEAVE THUS LOSERS PART 
A GENTLE RIDDANCE  DRAW THE CURTAINS GO 
LET ALL OF HIS COMPLEXION CHOOSE ME SO 
WHY MAN I SAW BASSANIO UNDER SAIL
WITH HIM IS GRATIANO GONE ALONG
AND IN THEIR SHIP I AM SURE LORENZO IS NOT 
THE VILLAIN JEW WITH OUTCRIES RAISED THE DUKE
WHO WENT WITH HIM TO SEARCH BASSANIOS SHIP 
HE CAME TOO LATE THE SHIP WAS UNDER SAIL
BUT THERE THE DUKE WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IN A GONDOLA WERE SEEN TOGETHER
LORENZO AND HIS AMOROUS JESSICA
BESIDES ANTONIO CERTIFIED THE DUKE
THEY WERE NOT WITH BASSANIO IN HIS SHIP 
I NEVER HEARD A PASSION SO CONFUSED
SO STRANGE OUTRAGEOUS AND SO VARIABLE
AS THE DOG JEW DID UTTER IN THE STREETS
MY DAUGHTER  O MY DUCATS  O MY DAUGHTER 
FLED WITH A CHRISTIAN  O MY CHRISTIAN DUCATS 
JUSTICE  THE LAW  MY DUCATS AND MY DAUGHTER 
A SEALED BAG TWO SEALED BAGS OF DUCATS
OF DOUBLE DUCATS STOLEN FROM ME BY MY DAUGHTER 
AND JEWELS TWO STONES TWO RICH AND PRECIOUS STONES
STOLEN BY MY DAUGHTER  JUSTICE  FIND THE GIRL
SHE HATH THE STONES UPON HER AND THE DUCATS 
WHY ALL THE BOYS IN VENICE FOLLOW HIM
CRYING HIS STONES HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS DUCATS 
LET GOOD ANTONIO LOOK HE KEEP HIS DAY
OR HE SHALL PAY FOR THIS 
MARRY WELL REMEMBERD 
I REASOND WITH A FRENCHMAN YESTERDAY
WHO TOLD ME IN THE NARROW SEAS THAT PART
THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH THERE MISCARRIED
A VESSEL OF OUR COUNTRY RICHLY FRAUGHT
I THOUGHT UPON ANTONIO WHEN HE TOLD ME
AND WISHD IN SILENCE THAT IT WERE NOT HIS 
YOU WERE BEST TO TELL ANTONIO WHAT YOU HEAR
YET DO NOT SUDDENLY FOR IT MAY GRIEVE HIM 
A KINDER GENTLEMAN TREADS NOT THE EARTH 
I SAW BASSANIO AND ANTONIO PART
BASSANIO TOLD HIM HE WOULD MAKE SOME SPEED
OF HIS RETURN HE ANSWERD DO NOT SO
SLUBBER NOT BUSINESS FOR MY SAKE BASSANIO
BUT STAY THE VERY RIPING OF THE TIME
AND FOR THE JEWS BOND WHICH HE HATH OF ME
LET IT NOT ENTER IN YOUR MIND OF LOVE
BE MERRY AND EMPLOY YOUR CHIEFEST THOUGHTS
TO COURTSHIP AND SUCH FAIR OSTENTS OF LOVE
AS SHALL CONVENIENTLY BECOME YOU THERE
AND EVEN THERE HIS EYE BEING BIG WITH TEARS
TURNING HIS FACE HE PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIM
AND WITH AFFECTION WONDROUS SENSIBLE
HE WRUNG BASSANIOS HAND AND SO THEY PARTED 
I THINK HE ONLY LOVES THE WORLD FOR HIM 
I PRAY THEE LET US GO AND FIND HIM OUT
AND QUICKEN HIS EMBRACED HEAVINESS
WITH SOME DELIGHT OR OTHER 
DO WE SO 
QUICK QUICK I PRAY THEE DRAW THE CURTAIN STRAIGHT
THE PRINCE OF ARRAGON HATH TAEN HIS OATH
AND COMES TO HIS ELECTION PRESENTLY 
BEHOLD THERE STAND THE CASKETS NOBLE PRINCE
IF YOU CHOOSE THAT WHEREIN I AM CONTAIND
STRAIGHT SHALL OUR NUPTIAL RITES BE SOLEMNIZED
BUT IF YOU FAIL WITHOUT MORE SPEECH MY LORD
YOU MUST BE GONE FROM HENCE IMMEDIATELY 
I AM ENJOIND BY OATH TO OBSERVE THREE THINGS
FIRST NEVER TO UNFOLD TO ANY ONE
WHICH CASKET TWAS I CHOSE NEXT IF I FAIL
OF THE RIGHT CASKET NEVER IN MY LIFE
TO WOO A MAID IN WAY OF MARRIAGE LASTLY
IF I DO FAIL IN FORTUNE OF MY CHOICE
IMMEDIATELY TO LEAVE YOU AND BE GONE 
TO THESE INJUNCTIONS EVERY ONE DOTH SWEAR
THAT COMES TO HAZARD FOR MY WORTHLESS SELF 
AND SO HAVE I ADDRESSD ME  FORTUNE NOW
TO MY HEARTS HOPE  GOLD SILVER AND BASE LEAD 
WHO CHOOSETH ME MUST GIVE AND HAZARD ALL HE HATH 
YOU SHALL LOOK FAIRER ERE I GIVE OR HAZARD 
WHAT SAYS THE GOLDEN CHEST HA  LET ME SEE
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GAIN WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE 
WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE  THAT MANY MAY BE MEANT
BY THE FOOL MULTITUDE THAT CHOOSE BY SHOW
NOT LEARNING MORE THAN THE FOND EYE DOTH TEACH
WHICH PRIES NOT TO THE INTERIOR BUT LIKE THE MARTLET
BUILDS IN THE WEATHER ON THE OUTWARD WALL
EVEN IN THE FORCE AND ROAD OF CASUALTY 
I WILL NOT CHOOSE WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE
BECAUSE I WILL NOT JUMP WITH COMMON SPIRITS
AND RANK ME WITH THE BARBAROUS MULTITUDES 
WHY THEN TO THEE THOU SILVER TREASUREHOUSE
TELL ME ONCE MORE WHAT TITLE THOU DOST BEAR
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GET AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES
AND WELL SAID TOO FOR WHO SHALL GO ABOUT
TO COZEN FORTUNE AND BE HONOURABLE
WITHOUT THE STAMP OF MERIT LET NONE PRESUME
TO WEAR AN UNDESERVED DIGNITY 
O THAT ESTATES DEGREES AND OFFICES
WERE NOT DERIVED CORRUPTLY AND THAT CLEAR HONOUR
WERE PURCHASED BY THE MERIT OF THE WEARER 
HOW MANY THEN SHOULD COVER THAT STAND BARE 
HOW MANY BE COMMANDED THAT COMMAND 
HOW MUCH LOW PEASANTRY WOULD THEN BE GLEAND
FROM THE TRUE SEED OF HONOUR  AND HOW MUCH HONOUR
PICKD FROM THE CHAFF AND RUIN OF THE TIMES
TO BE NEWVARNISHD  WELL BUT TO MY CHOICE
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GET AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES 
I WILL ASSUME DESERT  GIVE ME A KEY FOR THIS
AND INSTANTLY UNLOCK MY FORTUNES HERE 
TOO LONG A PAUSE FOR THAT WHICH YOU FIND THERE 
WHATS HERE THE PORTRAIT OF A BLINKING IDIOT
PRESENTING ME A SCHEDULE  I WILL READ IT 
HOW MUCH UNLIKE ART THOU TO PORTIA 
HOW MUCH UNLIKE MY HOPES AND MY DESERVINGS 
WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL HAVE AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES 
DID I DESERVE NO MORE THAN A FOOLS HEAD
IS THAT MY PRIZE ARE MY DESERTS NO BETTER
TO OFFEND AND JUDGE ARE DISTINCT OFFICES
AND OF OPPOSED NATURES 
WHAT IS HERE
THE FIRE SEVEN TIMES TRIED THIS
SEVEN TIMES TRIED THAT JUDGMENT IS
THAT DID NEVER CHOOSE AMISS 
SOME THERE BE THAT SHADOWS KISS
SUCH HAVE BUT A SHADOWS BLISS
THERE BE FOOLS ALIVE I WIS
SILVERD OER AND SO WAS THIS 
TAKE WHAT WIFE YOU WILL TO BED

BUT I GO AWAY WITH TWO 
SWEET ADIEU  ILL KEEP MY OATH
PATIENTLY TO BEAR MY WROTH 
THUS HATH THE CANDLE SINGED THE MOTH

I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT FOR A WILDERNESS OF MONKEYS 
BUT ANTONIO IS CERTAINLY UNDONE 
NAY THATS TRUE THATS VERY TRUE  GO TUBAL FEE
ME AN OFFICER BESPEAK HIM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE  I
WILL HAVE THE HEART OF HIM IF HE FORFEIT FOR WERE
HE OUT OF VENICE I CAN MAKE WHAT MERCHANDISE I
WILL  GO GO TUBAL AND MEET ME AT OUR SYNAGOGUE
GO GOOD TUBAL AT OUR SYNAGOGUE TUBAL 
I PRAY YOU TARRY PAUSE A DAY OR TWO
BEFORE YOU HAZARD FOR IN CHOOSING WRONG
I LOSE YOUR COMPANY THEREFORE FORBEAR AWHILE 
THERES SOMETHING TELLS ME BUT IT IS NOT LOVE
I WOULD NOT LOSE YOU AND YOU KNOW YOURSELF
HATE COUNSELS NOT IN SUCH A QUALITY 
BUT LEST YOU SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND ME WELL 
AND YET A MAIDEN HATH NO TONGUE BUT THOUGHT 
I WOULD DETAIN YOU HERE SOME MONTH OR TWO
BEFORE YOU VENTURE FOR ME  I COULD TEACH YOU
HOW TO CHOOSE RIGHT BUT I AM THEN FORSWORN
SO WILL I NEVER BE SO MAY YOU MISS ME
BUT IF YOU DO YOULL MAKE ME WISH A SIN
THAT I HAD BEEN FORSWORN  BESHREW YOUR EYES
THEY HAVE OERLOOKD ME AND DIVIDED ME
ONE HALF OF ME IS YOURS THE OTHER HALF YOURS
MINE OWN I WOULD SAY BUT IF MINE THEN YOURS
AND SO ALL YOURS  O THESE NAUGHTY TIMES
PUT BARS BETWEEN THE OWNERS AND THEIR RIGHTS 
AND SO THOUGH YOURS NOT YOURS  PROVE IT SO
LET FORTUNE GO TO HELL FOR IT NOT I 
I SPEAK TOO LONG BUT TIS TO PEIZE THE TIME
TO EKE IT AND TO DRAW IT OUT IN LENGTH
TO STAY YOU FROM ELECTION 
LET ME CHOOSE
FOR AS I AM I LIVE UPON THE RACK 
UPON THE RACK BASSANIO  THEN CONFESS
WHAT TREASON THERE IS MINGLED WITH YOUR LOVE 
NONE BUT THAT UGLY TREASON OF MISTRUST
WHICH MAKES ME FEAR THE ENJOYING OF MY LOVE
THERE MAY AS WELL BE AMITY AND LIFE
TWEEN SNOW AND FIRE AS TREASON AND MY LOVE 
AY BUT I FEAR YOU SPEAK UPON THE RACK
WHERE MEN ENFORCED DO SPEAK ANYTHING 
PROMISE ME LIFE AND ILL CONFESS THE TRUTH 
WELL THEN CONFESS AND LIVE 
CONFESS AND LOVE
HAD BEEN THE VERY SUM OF MY CONFESSION
O HAPPY TORMENT WHEN MY TORTURER
DOTH TEACH ME ANSWERS FOR DELIVERANCE 
BUT LET ME TO MY FORTUNE AND THE CASKETS 
AWAY THEN  I AM LOCKD IN ONE OF THEM
IF YOU DO LOVE ME YOU WILL FIND ME OUT 
NERISSA AND THE REST STAND ALL ALOOF 
LET MUSIC SOUND WHILE HE DOTH MAKE HIS CHOICE
THEN IF HE LOSE HE MAKES A SWANLIKE END
FADING IN MUSIC THAT THE COMPARISON
MAY STAND MORE PROPER MY EYE SHALL BE THE STREAM
AND WATERY DEATHBED FOR HIM  HE MAY WIN
AND WHAT IS MUSIC THEN THEN MUSIC IS
EVEN AS THE FLOURISH WHEN TRUE SUBJECTS BOW
TO A NEWCROWNED MONARCH SUCH IT IS
AS ARE THOSE DULCET SOUNDS IN BREAK OF DAY
THAT CREEP INTO THE DREAMING BRIDEGROOMS EAR
AND SUMMON HIM TO MARRIAGE  NOW HE GOES
WITH NO LESS PRESENCE BUT WITH MUCH MORE LOVE
THAN YOUNG ALCIDES WHEN HE DID REDEEM
THE VIRGIN TRIBUTE PAID BY HOWLING TROY
TO THE SEAMONSTER I STAND FOR SACRIFICE
THE REST ALOOF ARE THE DARDANIAN WIVES
WITH BLEARED VISAGES COME FORTH TO VIEW
THE ISSUE OF THE EXPLOIT  GO HERCULES 
LIVE THOU I LIVE WITH MUCH MUCH MORE DISMAY
I VIEW THE FIGHT THAN THOU THAT MAKEST THE FRAY 
TELL ME WHERE IS FANCY BRED
OR IN THE HEART OR IN THE HEAD
HOW BEGOT HOW NOURISHED
REPLY REPLY 
IT IS ENGENDERD IN THE EYES
WITH GAZING FED AND FANCY DIES
IN THE CRADLE WHERE IT LIES 
LET US ALL RING FANCYS KNELL
ILL BEGIN IT DING DONG BELL 
DING DONG BELL 
SO MAY THE OUTWARD SHOWS BE LEAST THEMSELVES
THE WORLD IS STILL DECEIVED WITH ORNAMENT 
IN LAW WHAT PLEA SO TAINTED AND CORRUPT
BUT BEING SEASONED WITH A GRACIOUS VOICE
OBSCURES THE SHOW OF EVIL IN RELIGION
WHAT DAMNED ERROR BUT SOME SOBER BROW
WILL BLESS IT AND APPROVE IT WITH A TEXT
HIDING THE GROSSNESS WITH FAIR ORNAMENT
THERE IS NO VICE SO SIMPLE BUT ASSUMES
SOME MARK OF VIRTUE ON HIS OUTWARD PARTS
HOW MANY COWARDS WHOSE HEARTS ARE ALL AS FALSE
AS STAIRS OF SAND WEAR YET UPON THEIR CHINS
THE BEARDS OF HERCULES AND FROWNING MARS
WHO INWARD SEARCHD HAVE LIVERS WHITE AS MILK
AND THESE ASSUME BUT VALOURS EXCREMENT
TO RENDER THEM REDOUBTED  LOOK ON BEAUTY
AND YOU SHALL SEE TIS PURCHASED BY THE WEIGHT
WHICH THEREIN WORKS A MIRACLE IN NATURE
MAKING THEM LIGHTEST THAT WEAR MOST OF IT
SO ARE THOSE CRISPED SNAKY GOLDEN LOCKS
WHICH MAKE SUCH WANTON GAMBOLS WITH THE WIND
UPON SUPPOSED FAIRNESS OFTEN KNOWN
TO BE THE DOWRY OF A SECOND HEAD
THE SKULL THAT BRED THEM IN THE SEPULCHRE 
THUS ORNAMENT IS BUT THE GUILED SHORE
TO A MOST DANGEROUS SEA THE BEAUTEOUS SCARF
VEILING AN INDIAN BEAUTY IN A WORD
THE SEEMING TRUTH WHICH CUNNING TIMES PUT ON
TO ENTRAP THE WISEST  THEREFORE THOU GAUDY GOLD
HARD FOOD FOR MIDAS I WILL NONE OF THEE
NOR NONE OF THEE THOU PALE AND COMMON DRUDGE
TWEEN MAN AND MAN BUT THOU THOU MEAGRE LEAD
WHICH RATHER THREATENEST THAN DOST PROMISE AUGHT
THY PALENESS MOVES ME MORE THAN ELOQUENCE
AND HERE CHOOSE I JOY BE THE CONSEQUENCE 
  HOW ALL THE OTHER PASSIONS FLEET TO AIR
AS DOUBTFUL THOUGHTS AND RASHEMBRACED DESPAIR
AND SHUDDERING FEAR AND GREENEYED JEALOUSY  O LOVE
BE MODERATE ALLAY THY ECSTASY
IN MEASURE REIN THY JOY SCANT THIS EXCESS 
I FEEL TOO MUCH THY BLESSING MAKE IT LESS
FOR FEAR I SURFEIT 
WHAT FIND I HERE
FAIR PORTIAS COUNTERFEIT  WHAT DEMIGOD
HATH COME SO NEAR CREATION MOVE THESE EYES
OR WHETHER RIDING ON THE BALLS OF MINE
SEEM THEY IN MOTION HERE ARE SEVERD LIPS
PARTED WITH SUGAR BREATH SO SWEET A BAR
SHOULD SUNDER SUCH SWEET FRIENDS  HERE IN HER HAIRS
THE PAINTER PLAYS THE SPIDER AND HATH WOVEN
A GOLDEN MESH TO ENTRAP THE HEARTS OF MEN
FASTER THAN GNATS IN COBWEBS BUT HER EYES 
HOW COULD HE SEE TO DO THEM HAVING MADE ONE
METHINKS IT SHOULD HAVE POWER TO STEAL BOTH HIS
AND LEAVE ITSELF UNFURNISHD  YET LOOK HOW FAR
THE SUBSTANCE OF MY PRAISE DOTH WRONG THIS SHADOW
IN UNDERPRIZING IT SO FAR THIS SHADOW
DOTH LIMP BEHIND THE SUBSTANCE  HERES THE SCROLL
THE CONTINENT AND SUMMARY OF MY FORTUNE 
YOU THAT CHOOSE NOT BY THE VIEW
CHANCE AS FAIR AND CHOOSE AS TRUE 
SINCE THIS FORTUNE FALLS TO YOU
BE CONTENT AND SEEK NO NEW
IF YOU BE WELL PLEASED WITH THIS
AND HOLD YOUR FORTUNE FOR YOUR BLISS
TURN YOU WHERE YOUR LADY IS
AND CLAIM HER WITH A LOVING KISS 
A GENTLE SCROLL  FAIR LADY BY YOUR LEAVE
I COME BY NOTE TO GIVE AND TO RECEIVE 
LIKE ONE OF TWO CONTENDING IN A PRIZE
THAT THINKS HE HATH DONE WELL IN PEOPLES EYES
HEARING APPLAUSE AND UNIVERSAL SHOUT
GIDDY IN SPIRIT STILL GAZING IN A DOUBT
WHETHER THESE PEARLS OF PRAISE BE HIS OR NO
SO THRICE FAIR LADY STAND I EVEN SO
AS DOUBTFUL WHETHER WHAT I SEE BE TRUE
UNTIL CONFIRMD SIGND RATIFIED BY YOU 
YOU SEE ME LORD BASSANIO WHERE I STAND
SUCH AS I AM THOUGH FOR MYSELF ALONE
I WOULD NOT BE AMBITIOUS IN MY WISH
TO WISH MYSELF MUCH BETTER YET FOR YOU
I WOULD BE TREBLED TWENTY TIMES MYSELF
A THOUSAND TIMES MORE FAIR TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE RICH
THAT ONLY TO STAND HIGH IN YOUR ACCOUNT
I MIGHT IN VIRTUE BEAUTIES LIVINGS FRIENDS
EXCEED ACCOUNT BUT THE FULL SUM OF ME
IS SUM OF SOMETHING WHICH TO TERM IN GROSS
IS AN UNLESSOND GIRL UNSCHOOLD UNPRACTISED
HAPPY IN THIS SHE IS NOT YET SO OLD
BUT SHE MAY LEARN HAPPIER THAN THIS
SHE IS NOT BRED SO DULL BUT SHE CAN LEARN
HAPPIEST OF ALL IS THAT HER GENTLE SPIRIT
COMMITS ITSELF TO YOURS TO BE DIRECTED
AS FROM HER LORD HER GOVERNOR HER KING 
MYSELF AND WHAT IS MINE TO YOU AND YOURS
IS NOW CONVERTED BUT NOW I WAS THE LORD
OF THIS FAIR MANSION MASTER OF MY SERVANTS
QUEEN OER MYSELF AND EVEN NOW BUT NOW
THIS HOUSE THESE SERVANTS AND THIS SAME MYSELF
ARE YOURS MY LORD I GIVE THEM WITH THIS RING
WHICH WHEN YOU PART FROM LOSE OR GIVE AWAY
LET IT PRESAGE THE RUIN OF YOUR LOVE
AND BE MY VANTAGE TO EXCLAIM ON YOU 
MADAM YOU HAVE BEREFT ME OF ALL WORDS
ONLY MY BLOOD SPEAKS TO YOU IN MY VEINS
AND THERE IS SUCH CONFUSION IN MY POWERS
AS AFTER SOME ORATION FAIRLY SPOKE
BY A BELOVED PRINCE THERE DOTH APPEAR
AMONG THE BUZZING PLEASED MULTITUDE
WHERE EVERY SOMETHING BEING BLENT TOGETHER
TURNS TO A WILD OF NOTHING SAVE OF JOY
EXPRESSD AND NOT EXPRESSD  BUT WHEN THIS RING
PARTS FROM THIS FINGER THEN PARTS LIFE FROM HENCE
O THEN BE BOLD TO SAY BASSANIOS DEAD 
MY LORD AND LADY IT IS NOW OUR TIME
THAT HAVE STOOD BY AND SEEN OUR WISHES PROSPER
TO CRY GOOD JOY GOOD JOY MY LORD AND LADY 
MY LORD BASSANIO AND MY GENTLE LADY
I WISH YOU ALL THE JOY THAT YOU CAN WISH
FOR I AM SURE YOU CAN WISH NONE FROM ME
AND WHEN YOUR HONOURS MEAN TO SOLEMNIZE
THE BARGAIN OF YOUR FAITH I DO BESEECH YOU
EVEN AT THAT TIME I MAY BE MARRIED TOO 
WITH ALL MY HEART SO THOU CANST GET A WIFE 
I THANK YOUR LORDSHIP YOU HAVE GOT ME ONE 
MY EYES MY LORD CAN LOOK AS SWIFT AS YOURS
YOU SAW THE MISTRESS I BEHELD THE MAID
YOU LOVED I LOVED FOR INTERMISSION 
NO MORE PERTAINS TO ME MY LORD THAN YOU 
YOUR FORTUNE STOOD UPON THE CASKET THERE
AND SO DID MINE TOO AS THE MATTER FALLS
FOR WOOING HERE UNTIL I SWEAT AGAIN
AND SWEATING UNTIL MY VERY ROOF WAS DRY
WITH OATHS OF LOVE AT LAST IF PROMISE LAST
I GOT A PROMISE OF THIS FAIR ONE HERE

BESIDES IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT IF HE HAD
THE PRESENT MONEY TO DISCHARGE THE JEW
HE WOULD NOT TAKE IT  NEVER DID I KNOW
A CREATURE THAT DID BEAR THE SHAPE OF MAN
SO KEEN AND GREEDY TO CONFOUND A MAN
HE PLIES THE DUKE AT MORNING AND AT NIGHT
AND DOTH IMPEACH THE FREEDOM OF THE STATE
IF THEY DENY HIM JUSTICE TWENTY MERCHANTS
THE DUKE HIMSELF AND THE MAGNIFICOES
OF GREATEST PORT HAVE ALL PERSUADED WITH HIM
BUT NONE CAN DRIVE HIM FROM THE ENVIOUS PLEA
OF FORFEITURE OF JUSTICE AND HIS BOND 
WHEN I WAS WITH HIM I HAVE HEARD HIM SWEAR
TO TUBAL AND TO CHUS HIS COUNTRYMEN
THAT HE WOULD RATHER HAVE ANTONIOS FLESH
THAN TWENTY TIMES THE VALUE OF THE SUM
THAT HE DID OWE HIM AND I KNOW MY LORD
IF LAW AUTHORITY AND POWER DENY NOT
IT WILL GO HARD WITH POOR ANTONIO 
IS IT YOUR DEAR FRIEND THAT IS THUS IN TROUBLE
THE DEAREST FRIEND TO ME THE KINDEST MAN
THE BESTCONDITIOND AND UNWEARIED SPIRIT
IN DOING COURTESIES AND ONE IN WHOM

THAN ANY THAT DRAWS BREATH IN ITALY 
WHAT SUM OWES HE THE JEW

WHAT NO MORE
PAY HIM SIX THOUSAND AND DEFACE THE BOND
DOUBLE SIX THOUSAND AND THEN TREBLE THAT
BEFORE A FRIEND OF THIS DESCRIPTION
SHALL LOSE A HAIR THROUGH BASSANIOS FAULT 
FIRST GO WITH ME TO CHURCH AND CALL ME WIFE

TO COME ABROAD WITH HIM AT HIS REQUEST 
I PRAY THEE HEAR ME SPEAK 
ILL HAVE MY BOND I WILL NOT HEAR THEE SPEAK

ILL NOT BE MADE A SOFT AND DULLEYED FOOL
TO SHAKE THE HEAD RELENT AND SIGH AND YIELD
TO CHRISTIAN INTERCESSORS  FOLLOW NOT

IT IS THE MOST IMPENETRABLE CUR
THAT EVER KEPT WITH MEN 
LET HIM ALONE
ILL FOLLOW HIM NO MORE WITH BOOTLESS PRAYERS 
HE SEEKS MY LIFE HIS REASON WELL I KNOW
I OFT DELIVERD FROM HIS FORFEITURES
MANY THAT HAVE AT TIMES MADE MOAN TO ME
THEREFORE HE HATES ME 
I AM SURE THE DUKE
WILL NEVER GRANT THIS FORFEITURE TO HOLD 
THE DUKE CANNOT DENY THE COURSE OF LAW
FOR THE COMMODITY THAT STRANGERS HAVE
WITH US IN VENICE IF IT BE DENIED
WILL MUCH IMPEACH THE JUSTICE OF HIS STATE
SINCE THAT THE TRADE AND PROFIT OF THE CITY
CONSISTETH OF ALL NATIONS  THEREFORE GO

TOMORROW TO MY BLOODY CREDITOR 
WELL GAOLER ON  PRAY GOD BASSANIO COME

MADAM ALTHOUGH I SPEAK IT IN YOUR PRESENCE
YOU HAVE A NOBLE AND A TRUE CONCEIT
OF GODLIKE AMITY WHICH APPEARS MOST STRONGLY
IN BEARING THUS THE ABSENCE OF YOUR LORD 
BUT IF YOU KNEW TO WHOM YOU SHOW THIS HONOUR
HOW TRUE A GENTLEMAN YOU SEND RELIEF
HOW DEAR A LOVER OF MY LORD YOUR HUSBAND
I KNOW YOU WOULD BE PROUDER OF THE WORK
THAN CUSTOMARY BOUNTY CAN ENFORCE YOU 
I NEVER DID REPENT FOR DOING GOOD
NOR SHALL NOT NOW FOR IN COMPANIONS
THAT DO CONVERSE AND WASTE THE TIME TOGETHER
WHOSE SOULS DO BEAR AN EQUAL YOKE OF LOVE
THERE MUST BE NEEDS A LIKE PROPORTION
OF LINEAMENTS OF MANNERS AND OF SPIRIT
WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THIS ANTONIO
BEING THE BOSOM LOVER OF MY LORD
MUST NEEDS BE LIKE MY LORD  IF IT BE SO
HOW LITTLE IS THE COST I HAVE BESTOWD
IN PURCHASING THE SEMBLANCE OF MY SOUL
FROM OUT THE STATE OF HELLISH MISERY

THEREFORE NO MORE OF IT HEAR OTHER THINGS 
LORENZO I COMMIT INTO YOUR HANDS
THE HUSBANDRY AND MANAGE OF MY HOUSE
UNTIL MY LORDS RETURN FOR MINE OWN PART
I HAVE TOWARD HEAVEN BREATHED A SECRET VOW
TO LIVE IN PRAYER AND CONTEMPLATION

THE THRONED MONARCH BETTER THAN HIS CROWN
HIS SCEPTRE SHOWS THE FORCE OF TEMPORAL POWER
THE ATTRIBUTE TO AWE AND MAJESTY
WHEREIN DOTH SIT THE DREAD AND FEAR OF KINGS
BUT MERCY IS ABOVE THIS SCEPTRED SWAY

AND EARTHLY POWER DOTH THEN SHOW LIKEST GODS
WHEN MERCY SEASONS JUSTICE  THEREFORE JEW

THAT IN THE COURSE OF JUSTICE NONE OF US
SHOULD SEE SALVATION WE DO PRAY FOR MERCY

THE MOON SHINES BRIGHT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
WHEN THE SWEET WIND DID GENTLY KISS THE TREES
AND THEY DID MAKE NO NOISE IN SUCH A NIGHT
TROILUS METHINKS MOUNTED THE TROYAN WALLS
AND SIGHD HIS SOUL TOWARD THE GRECIAN TENTS
WHERE CRESSID LAY THAT NIGHT 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
DID THISBE FEARFULLY OERTRIP THE DEW
AND SAW THE LIONS SHADOW ERE HIMSELF
AND RAN DISMAYD AWAY 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
STOOD DIDO WITH A WILLOW IN HER HAND
UPON THE WILD SEA BANKS AND WAFT HER LOVE
TO COME AGAIN TO CARTHAGE 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
MEDEA GATHERD THE ENCHANTED HERBS
THAT DID RENEW OLD AESON 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
DID JESSICA STEAL FROM THE WEALTHY JEW
AND WITH AN UNTHRIFT LOVE DID RUN FROM VENICE
AS FAR AS BELMONT 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
DID YOUNG LORENZO SWEAR HE LOVED HER WELL
STEALING HER SOUL WITH MANY VOWS OF FAITH
AND NEER A TRUE ONE 
IN SUCH A NIGHT
DID PRETTY JESSICA LIKE A LITTLE SHREW
SLANDER HER LOVE AND HE FORGAVE IT HER 
I WOULD OUTNIGHT YOU DID NO BODY COME
BUT HARK I HEAR THE FOOTING OF A MAN 
WHO COMES SO FAST IN SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
A FRIEND 
A FRIEND  WHAT FRIEND YOUR NAME I PRAY YOU FRIEND
STEPHANO IS MY NAME AND I BRING WORD
MY MISTRESS WILL BEFORE THE BREAK OF DAY
BE HERE AT BELMONT SHE DOTH STRAY ABOUT
BY HOLY CROSSES WHERE SHE KNEELS AND PRAYS
FOR HAPPY WEDLOCK HOURS 
WHO COMES WITH HER
NONE BUT A HOLY HERMIT AND HER MAID 
I PRAY YOU IS MY MASTER YET RETURND
HE IS NOT NOR WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM 
BUT GO WE IN I PRAY THEE JESSICA
AND CEREMONIOUSLY LET US PREPARE
SOME WELCOME FOR THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE 
SOLA SOLA  WO HA HO  SOLA SOLA 
WHO CALLS

MASTER LORENZO SOLA SOLA 
LEAVE HOLLAING MAN HERE 
SOLA  WHERE WHERE

HIS HORN FULL OF GOOD NEWS MY MASTER WILL BE HERE
ERE MORNING 
SWEET SOUL LETS IN AND THERE EXPECT THEIR COMING 
AND YET NO MATTER WHY SHOULD WE GO IN
MY FRIEND STEPHANO SIGNIFY I PRAY YOU
WITHIN THE HOUSE YOUR MISTRESS IS AT HAND
AND BRING YOUR MUSIC FORTH INTO THE AIR 
HOW SWEET THE MOONLIGHT SLEEPS UPON THIS BANK 
HERE WILL WE SIT AND LET THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC
CREEP IN OUR EARS SOFT STILLNESS AND THE NIGHT
BECOME THE TOUCHES OF SWEET HARMONY 
SIT JESSICA  LOOK HOW THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN
IS THICK INLAID WITH PATINES OF BRIGHT GOLD
THERES NOT THE SMALLEST ORB WHICH THOU BEHOLDST
BUT IN HIS MOTION LIKE AN ANGEL SINGS
STILL QUIRING TO THE YOUNGEYED CHERUBINS
SUCH HARMONY IS IN IMMORTAL SOULS
BUT WHILST THIS MUDDY VESTURE OF DECAY
DOTH GROSSLY CLOSE IT IN WE CANNOT HEAR IT 
COME HO  AND WAKE DIANA WITH A HYMN 
WITH SWEETEST TOUCHES PIERCE YOUR MISTRESS EAR
AND DRAW HER HOME WITH MUSIC 
I AM NEVER MERRY WHEN I HEAR SWEET MUSIC 
THE REASON IS YOUR SPIRITS ARE ATTENTIVE
FOR DO BUT NOTE A WILD AND WANTON HERD
OR RACE OF YOUTHFUL AND UNHANDLED COLTS
FETCHING MAD BOUNDS BELLOWING AND NEIGHING LOUD
WHICH IS THE HOT CONDITION OF THEIR BLOOD
IF THEY BUT HEAR PERCHANCE A TRUMPET SOUND
OR ANY AIR OF MUSIC TOUCH THEIR EARS
YOU SHALL PERCEIVE THEM MAKE A MUTUAL STAND
THEIR SAVAGE EYES TURND TO A MODEST GAZE
BY THE SWEET POWER OF MUSIC THEREFORE THE POET
DID FEIGN THAT ORPHEUS DREW TREES STONES AND FLOODS
SINCE NOUGHT SO STOCKISH HARD AND FULL OF RAGE
BUT MUSIC FOR THE TIME DOTH CHANGE HIS NATURE 
THE MAN THAT HATH NO MUSIC IN HIMSELF
NOR IS NOT MOVED WITH CONCORD OF SWEET SOUNDS
IS FIT FOR TREASONS STRATAGEMS AND SPOILS
THE MOTIONS OF HIS SPIRIT ARE DULL AS NIGHT
AND HIS AFFECTIONS DARK AS EREBUS
LET NO SUCH MAN BE TRUSTED  MARK THE MUSIC 
THAT LIGHT WE SEE IS BURNING IN MY HALL 
HOW FAR THAT LITTLE CANDLE THROWS HIS BEAMS 
SO SHINES A GOOD DEED IN A NAUGHTY WORLD 
WHEN THE MOON SHONE WE DID NOT SEE THE CANDLE 
SO DOTH THE GREATER GLORY DIM THE LESS
A SUBSTITUTE SHINES BRIGHTLY AS A KING
UNTO THE KING BE BY AND THEN HIS STATE
EMPTIES ITSELF AS DOTH AN INLAND BROOK
INTO THE MAIN OF WATERS  MUSIC  HARK 
IT IS YOUR MUSIC MADAM OF THE HOUSE 
NOTHING IS GOOD I SEE WITHOUT RESPECT
METHINKS IT SOUNDS MUCH SWEETER THAN BY DAY 
SILENCE BESTOWS THAT VIRTUE ON IT MADAM 
THE CROW DOTH SING AS SWEETLY AS THE LARK
WHEN NEITHER IS ATTENDED AND I THINK
THE NIGHTINGALE IF SHE SHOULD SING BY DAY
WHEN EVERY GOOSE IS CACKLING WOULD BE THOUGHT
NO BETTER A MUSICIAN THAN THE WREN 
HOW MANY THINGS BY SEASON SEASOND ARE
TO THEIR RIGHT PRAISE AND TRUE PERFECTION 
PEACE HO  THE MOON SLEEPS WITH ENDYMION
AND WOULD NOT BE AWAKED 
THAT IS THE VOICE
OR I AM MUCH DECEIVED OF PORTIA 
HE KNOWS ME AS THE BLIND MAN KNOWS THE CUCKOO
BY THE BAD VOICE 
DEAR LADY WELCOME HOME 
WE HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR OUR HUSBANDS HEALTHS
WHICH SPEED WE HOPE THE BETTER FOR OUR WORDS 
ARE THEY RETURND
MADAM THEY ARE NOT YET
BUT THERE IS COME A MESSENGER BEFORE
TO SIGNIFY THEIR COMING 
GO IN NERISSA
GIVE ORDER TO MY SERVANTS THAT THEY TAKE
NO NOTE AT ALL OF OUR BEING ABSENT HENCE
NOR YOU LORENZO JESSICA NOR YOU 
YOUR HUSBAND IS AT HAND I HEAR HIS TRUMPET
WE ARE NO TELLTALES MADAM FEAR YOU NOT 
THIS NIGHT METHINKS IS BUT THE DAYLIGHT SICK
IT LOOKS A LITTLE PALER TIS A DAY
SUCH AS THE DAY IS WHEN THE SUN IS HID 
WE SHOULD HOLD DAY WITH THE ANTIPODES
IF YOU WOULD WALK IN ABSENCE OF THE SUN 
LET ME GIVE LIGHT BUT LET ME NOT BE LIGHT
FOR A LIGHT WIFE DOTH MAKE A HEAVY HUSBAND
AND NEVER BE BASSANIO SO FOR ME
BUT GOD SORT ALL  YOU ARE WELCOME HOME MY LORD 
I THANK YOU MADAM  GIVE WELCOME TO MY FRIEND 
THIS IS THE MAN THIS IS ANTONIO
TO WHOM I AM SO INFINITELY BOUND 
YOU SHOULD IN ALL SENSE BE MUCH BOUND TO HIM 
FOR AS I HEAR HE WAS MUCH BOUND FOR YOU 
NO MORE THAN I AM WELL ACQUITTED OF 
SIR YOU ARE VERY WELCOME TO OUR HOUSE
IT MUST APPEAR IN OTHER WAYS THAN WORDS
THEREFORE I SCANT THIS BREATHING COURTESY 
  BY YONDER MOON I SWEAR YOU DO ME WRONG
IN FAITH I GAVE IT TO THE JUDGES CLERK
WOULD HE WERE GELT THAT HAD IT FOR MY PART
SINCE YOU DO TAKE IT LOVE SO MUCH AT HEART 
A QUARREL HO ALREADY  WHATS THE MATTER
ABOUT A HOOP OF GOLD A PALTRY RING
THAT SHE DID GIVE ME WHOSE POSY WAS
FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE CUTLERS POETRY
UPON A KNIFE LOVE ME AND LEAVE ME NOT 
WHAT TALK YOU OF THE POSY OR THE VALUE
YOU SWORE TO ME WHEN I DID GIVE IT YOU
THAT YOU WOULD WEAR IT TILL YOUR HOUR OF DEATH
AND THAT IT SHOULD LIE WITH YOU IN YOUR GRAVE
THOUGH NOT FOR ME YET FOR YOUR VEHEMENT OATHS
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESPECTIVE AND HAVE KEPT IT 
GAVE IT A JUDGES CLERK  NO GODS MY JUDGE
THE CLERK WILL NEER WEAR HAIR ONS FACE THAT HAD IT 
HE WILL AN IF HE LIVE TO BE A MAN 
AY IF A WOMAN LIVE TO BE A MAN 
NOW BY THIS HAND I GAVE IT TO A YOUTH
A KIND OF BOY A LITTLE SCRUBBED BOY
NO HIGHER THAN THYSELF THE JUDGES CLERK
A PRATING BOY THAT BEGGD IT AS A FEE
I COULD NOT FOR MY HEART DENY IT HIM 
YOU WERE TO BLAME I MUST BE PLAIN WITH YOU
TO PART SO SLIGHTLY WITH YOUR WIFES FIRST GIFT
A THING STUCK ON WITH OATHS UPON YOUR FINGER
AND SO RIVETED WITH FAITH UNTO YOUR FLESH 
I GAVE MY LOVE A RING AND MADE HIM SWEAR
NEVER TO PART WITH IT AND HERE HE STANDS
I DARE BE SWORN FOR HIM HE WOULD NOT LEAVE IT
NOR PLUCK IT FROM HIS FINGER FOR THE WEALTH
THAT THE WORLD MASTERS  NOW IN FAITH GRATIANO
YOU GIVE YOUR WIFE TOO UNKIND A CAUSE OF GRIEF
AN TWERE TO ME I SHOULD BE MAD AT IT 
  WHY I WERE BEST TO CUT MY LEFT HAND OFF
AND SWEAR I LOST THE RING DEFENDING IT 
MY LORD BASSANIO GAVE HIS RING AWAY
UNTO THE JUDGE THAT BEGGD IT AND INDEED
DESERVED IT TOO AND THEN THE BOY HIS CLERK
THAT TOOK SOME PAINS IN WRITING HE BEGGD MINE
AND NEITHER MAN NOR MASTER WOULD TAKE AUGHT
BUT THE TWO RINGS 
WHAT RING GAVE YOU MY LORD
NOT THAT I HOPE WHICH YOU RECEIVED OF ME 
IF I COULD ADD A LIE UNTO A FAULT
I WOULD DENY IT BUT YOU SEE MY FINGER
HATH NOT THE RING UPON IT IT IS GONE 
EVEN SO VOID IS YOUR FALSE HEART OF TRUTH 
BY HEAVEN I WILL NEER COME IN YOUR BED
UNTIL I SEE THE RING 
NOR I IN YOURS
TILL I AGAIN SEE MINE 
SWEET PORTIA
IF YOU DID KNOW TO WHOM I GAVE THE RING
IF YOU DID KNOW FOR WHOM I GAVE THE RING
AND WOULD CONCEIVE FOR WHAT I GAVE THE RING
AND HOW UNWILLINGLY I LEFT THE RING
WHEN NOUGHT WOULD BE ACCEPTED BUT THE RING
YOU WOULD ABATE THE STRENGTH OF YOUR DISPLEASURE 
IF YOU HAD KNOWN THE VIRTUE OF THE RING
OR HALF HER WORTHINESS THAT GAVE THE RING
OR YOUR OWN HONOUR TO CONTAIN THE RING
YOU WOULD NOT THEN HAVE PARTED WITH THE RING 
WHAT MAN IS THERE SO MUCH UNREASONABLE
IF YOU HAD PLEASED TO HAVE DEFENDED IT
WITH ANY TERMS OF ZEAL WANTED THE MODESTY
TO URGE THE THING HELD AS A CEREMONY
NERISSA TEACHES ME WHAT TO BELIEVE
ILL DIE FORT BUT SOME WOMAN HAD THE RING 
NO BY MY HONOUR MADAM BY MY SOUL
NO WOMAN HAD IT BUT A CIVIL DOCTOR
WHICH DID REFUSE THREE THOUSAND DUCATS OF ME
AND BEGGD THE RING THE WHICH I DID DENY HIM
AND SUFFERD HIM TO GO DISPLEASED AWAY
EVEN HE THAT DID UPHOLD THE VERY LIFE
OF MY DEAR FRIEND  WHAT SHOULD I SAY SWEET LADY

HAD YOU BEEN THERE I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BEGGD
THE RING OF ME TO GIVE THE WORTHY DOCTOR

AND THAT WHICH YOU DID SWEAR TO KEEP FOR ME

ILL NOT DENY HIM ANY THING I HAVE
NO NOT MY BODY NOR MY HUSBANDS BED
KNOW HIM I SHALL I AM WELL SURE OF IT

NOW BY MINE HONOUR WHICH IS YET MINE OWN
ILL HAVE THAT DOCTOR FOR MY BEDFELLOW 
AND I HIS CLERK THEREFORE BE WELL ADVISED
HOW YOU DO LEAVE ME TO MINE OWN PROTECTION 
WELL DO YOU SO LET NOT ME TAKE HIM THEN
FOR IF I DO ILL MAR THE YOUNG CLERKS PEN 
I AM THE UNHAPPY SUBJECT OF THESE QUARRELS 
SIR GRIEVE NOT YOU YOU ARE WELCOME NOTWITHSTANDING 
PORTIA FORGIVE ME THIS ENFORCED WRONG
AND IN THE HEARING OF THESE MANY FRIENDS
I SWEAR TO THEE EVEN BY THINE OWN FAIR EYES
WHEREIN I SEE MYSELF 
MARK YOU BUT THAT

I ONCE DID LEND MY BODY FOR HIS WEALTH
