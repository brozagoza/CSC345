REBELLIOUS SUBJECTS ENEMIES TO PEACE

WITH PURPLE FOUNTAINS ISSUING FROM YOUR VEINS
ON PAIN OF TORTURE FROM THOSE BLOODY HANDS

THREE CIVIL BRAWLS BRED OF AN AIRY WORD

TO KNOW OUR FURTHER PLEASURE IN THIS CASE
TO OLD FREETOWN OUR COMMON JUDGMENTPLACE 
ONCE MORE ON PAIN OF DEATH ALL MEN DEPART 
WHO SET THIS ANCIENT QUARREL NEW ABROACH
SPEAK NEPHEW WERE YOU BY WHEN IT BEGAN
HERE WERE THE SERVANTS OF YOUR ADVERSARY
AND YOURS CLOSE FIGHTING ERE I DID APPROACH
I DREW TO PART THEM IN THE INSTANT CAME
THE FIERY TYBALT WITH HIS SWORD PREPARED
WHICH AS HE BREATHED DEFIANCE TO MY EARS
HE SWUNG ABOUT HIS HEAD AND CUT THE WINDS
WHO NOTHING HURT WITHAL HISSD HIM IN SCORN
WHILE WE WERE INTERCHANGING THRUSTS AND BLOWS
CAME MORE AND MORE AND FOUGHT ON PART AND PART
TILL THE PRINCE CAME WHO PARTED EITHER PART 
O WHERE IS ROMEO SAW YOU HIM TODAY
RIGHT GLAD I AM HE WAS NOT AT THIS FRAY 
MADAM AN HOUR BEFORE THE WORSHIPPD SUN
PEERD FORTH THE GOLDEN WINDOW OF THE EAST
A TROUBLED MIND DRAVE ME TO WALK ABROAD
WHERE UNDERNEATH THE GROVE OF SYCAMORE
THAT WESTWARD ROOTETH FROM THE CITYS SIDE
SO EARLY WALKING DID I SEE YOUR SON
TOWARDS HIM I MADE BUT HE WAS WARE OF ME
AND STOLE INTO THE COVERT OF THE WOOD
I MEASURING HIS AFFECTIONS BY MY OWN
THAT MOST ARE BUSIED WHEN THEYRE MOST ALONE
PURSUED MY HUMOUR NOT PURSUING HIS
AND GLADLY SHUNND WHO GLADLY FLED FROM ME 
MANY A MORNING HATH HE THERE BEEN SEEN
WITH TEARS AUGMENTING THE FRESH MORNING DEW 
ADDING TO CLOUDS MORE CLOUDS WITH HIS DEEP SIGHS
BUT ALL SO SOON AS THE ALLCHEERING SUN
SHOULD IN THE FURTHEST EAST BEGIN TO DRAW
THE SHADY CURTAINS FROM AURORAS BED
AWAY FROM THE LIGHT STEALS HOME MY HEAVY SON
AND PRIVATE IN HIS CHAMBER PENS HIMSELF
SHUTS UP HIS WINDOWS LOCKS FAR DAYLIGHT OUT
AND MAKES HIMSELF AN ARTIFICIAL NIGHT
BLACK AND PORTENTOUS MUST THIS HUMOUR PROVE
UNLESS GOOD COUNSEL MAY THE CAUSE REMOVE 
MY NOBLE UNCLE DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE
I NEITHER KNOW IT NOR CAN LEARN OF HIM 
HAVE YOU IMPORTUNED HIM BY ANY MEANS
BOTH BY MYSELF AND MANY OTHER FRIENDS
BUT HE HIS OWN AFFECTIONS COUNSELLOR
IS TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT SAY HOW TRUE 
BUT TO HIMSELF SO SECRET AND SO CLOSE
SO FAR FROM SOUNDING AND DISCOVERY
AS IS THE BUD BIT WITH AN ENVIOUS WORM
ERE HE CAN SPREAD HIS SWEET LEAVES TO THE AIR
OR DEDICATE HIS BEAUTY TO THE SUN 
COULD WE BUT LEARN FROM WHENCE HIS SORROWS GROW 
WE WOULD AS WILLINGLY GIVE CURE AS KNOW 
SEE WHERE HE COMES SO PLEASE YOU STEP ASIDE
ILL KNOW HIS GRIEVANCE OR BE MUCH DENIED 
I WOULD THOU WERT SO HAPPY BY THY STAY
TO HEAR TRUE SHRIFT  COME MADAM LETS AWAY 
GOODMORROW COUSIN 
IS THE DAY SO YOUNG
BUT NEW STRUCK NINE 
AY ME  SAD HOURS SEEM LONG 
WAS THAT MY FATHER THAT WENT HENCE SO FAST
IT WAS  WHAT SADNESS LENGTHENS ROMEOS HOURS
NOT HAVING THAT WHICH HAVING MAKES THEM SHORT 
IN LOVE
OUT 
OF LOVE
OUT OF HER FAVOUR WHERE I AM IN LOVE 
ALAS THAT LOVE SO GENTLE IN HIS VIEW
SHOULD BE SO TYRANNOUS AND ROUGH IN PROOF 
ALAS THAT LOVE WHOSE VIEW IS MUFFLED STILL
SHOULD WITHOUT EYES SEE PATHWAYS TO HIS WILL 
WHERE SHALL WE DINE O ME  WHAT FRAY WAS HERE
YET TELL ME NOT FOR I HAVE HEARD IT ALL 
HERES MUCH TO DO WITH HATE BUT MORE WITH LOVE 
WHY THEN O BRAWLING LOVE  O LOVING HATE 
O ANY THING OF NOTHING FIRST CREATE 
O HEAVY LIGHTNESS  SERIOUS VANITY 
MISSHAPEN CHAOS OF WELLSEEMING FORMS 
FEATHER OF LEAD BRIGHT SMOKE COLD FIRE
SICK HEALTH 
STILLWAKING SLEEP THAT IS NOT WHAT IT IS 
THIS LOVE FEEL I THAT FEEL NO LOVE IN THIS 
DOST THOU NOT LAUGH
NO COZ I RATHER WEEP 
GOOD HEART AT WHAT
AT THY GOOD HEARTS OPPRESSION 
WHY SUCH IS LOVES TRANSGRESSION 
GRIEFS OF MINE OWN LIE HEAVY IN MY BREAST
WHICH THOU WILT PROPAGATE TO HAVE IT PREST
WITH MORE OF THINE THIS LOVE THAT THOU HAST SHOWN
DOTH ADD MORE GRIEF TO TOO MUCH OF MINE OWN 
LOVE IS A SMOKE RAISED WITH THE FUME OF SIGHS
BEING PURGED A FIRE SPARKLING IN LOVERS EYES
BEING VEXD A SEA NOURISHD WITH LOVERS TEARS
WHAT IS IT ELSE A MADNESS MOST DISCREET
A CHOKING GALL AND A PRESERVING SWEET 
FAREWELL MY COZ

FROM LOVES WEAK CHILDISH BOW SHE LIVES UNHARMD 
SHE WILL NOT STAY THE SIEGE OF LOVING TERMS
NOR BIDE THE ENCOUNTER OF ASSAILING EYES
NOR OPE HER LAP TO SAINTSEDUCING GOLD
O SHE IS RICH IN BEAUTY ONLY POOR
THAT WHEN SHE DIES WITH BEAUTY DIES HER STORE 
THEN SHE HATH SWORN THAT SHE WILL STILL LIVE CHASTE
SHE HATH AND IN THAT SPARING MAKES HUGE WASTE
FOR BEAUTY STARVED WITH HER SEVERITY
CUTS BEAUTY OFF FROM ALL POSTERITY 
SHE IS TOO FAIR TOO WISE WISELY TOO FAIR
TO MERIT BLISS BY MAKING ME DESPAIR
SHE HATH FORSWORN TO LOVE AND IN THAT VOW
DO I LIVE DEAD THAT LIVE TO TELL IT NOW 
BE RULED BY ME FORGET TO THINK OF HER 
O TEACH ME HOW I SHOULD FORGET TO THINK 
BY GIVING LIBERTY UNTO THINE EYES
EXAMINE OTHER BEAUTIES 
TIS THE WAY
TO CALL HERS EXQUISITE IN QUESTION MORE
THESE HAPPY MASKS THAT KISS FAIR LADIES BROWS
BEING BLACK PUT US IN MIND THEY HIDE THE FAIR
HE THAT IS STRUCKEN BLIND CANNOT FORGET
THE PRECIOUS TREASURE OF HIS EYESIGHT LOST
SHOW ME A MISTRESS THAT IS PASSING FAIR
WHAT DOTH HER BEAUTY SERVE BUT AS A NOTE
WHERE I MAY READ WHO PASSD THAT PASSING FAIR
FAREWELL THOU CANST NOT TEACH ME TO FORGET

YOUNGER THAN SHE ARE HAPPY MOTHERS MADE 
AND TOO SOON MARRD ARE THOSE SO EARLY MADE 
THE EARTH HATH SWALLOWD ALL MY HOPES BUT SHE

TWO OF THE FAIREST STARS IN ALL THE HEAVEN
HAVING SOME BUSINESS DO ENTREAT HER EYES
TO TWINKLE IN THEIR SPHERES TILL THEY RETURN 
WHAT IF HER EYES WERE THERE THEY IN HER HEAD
THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER CHEEK WOULD SHAME THOSE STARS
AS DAYLIGHT DOTH A LAMP HER EYES IN HEAVEN

SEE HOW SHE LEANS HER CHEEK UPON HER HAND 
O THAT I WERE A GLOVE UPON THAT HAND
THAT I MIGHT TOUCH THAT CHEEK

A THING LIKE DEATH TO CHIDE AWAY THIS SHAME
THAT COPEST WITH DEATH HIMSELF TO SCAPE FROM IT
AND IF THOU DAREST ILL GIVE THEE REMEDY 
O BID ME LEAP RATHER THAN MARRY PARIS
FROM OFF THE BATTLEMENTS OF YONDER TOWER
OR WALK IN THIEVISH WAYS OR BID ME LURK
WHERE SERPENTS ARE CHAIN ME WITH ROARING BEARS
OR SHUT ME NIGHTLY IN A CHARNELHOUSE
OERCOVERD QUITE WITH DEAD MENS RATTLING BONES
WITH REEKY SHANKS AND YELLOW CHAPLESS SKULLS
OR BID ME GO INTO A NEWMADE GRAVE
AND HIDE ME WITH A DEAD MAN IN HIS SHROUD
THINGS THAT TO HEAR THEM TOLD HAVE MADE ME TREMBLE
AND I WILL DO IT WITHOUT FEAR OR DOUBT
TO LIVE AN UNSTAIND WIFE TO MY SWEET LOVE

OF ILLSHAPED FISHES AND ABOUT HIS SHELVES
A BEGGARLY ACCOUNT OF EMPTY BOXES
GREEN EARTHEN POTS BLADDERS AND MUSTY SEEDS
REMNANTS OF PACKTHREAD AND OLD CAKES OF ROSES
