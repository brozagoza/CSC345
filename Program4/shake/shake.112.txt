BRAVE PEERS OF ENGLAND PILLARS OF THE STATE
TO YOU DUKE HUMPHREY MUST UNLOAD HIS GRIEF
YOUR GRIEF THE COMMON GRIEF OF ALL THE LAND 
WHAT  DID MY BROTHER HENRY SPEND HIS YOUTH
HIS VALOUR COIN AND PEOPLE IN THE WARS
DID HE SO OFTEN LODGE IN OPEN FIELD
IN WINTERS COLD AND SUMMERS PARCHING HEAT
TO CONQUER FRANCE HIS TRUE INHERITANCE
AND DID MY BROTHER BEDFORD TOIL HIS WITS
TO KEEP BY POLICY WHAT HENRY GOT
HAVE YOU YOURSELVES SOMERSET BUCKINGHAM
BRAVE YORK SALISBURY AND VICTORIOUS WARWICK
RECEIVED DEEP SCARS IN FRANCE AND NORMANDY
OR HATH MINE UNCLE BEAUFORT AND MYSELF
WITH ALL THE LEARNED COUNCIL OF THE REALM
STUDIED SO LONG SAT IN THE COUNCILHOUSE
EARLY AND LATE DEBATING TO AND FRO
HOW FRANCE AND FRENCHMEN MIGHT BE KEPT IN AWE
AND HAD HIS HIGHNESS IN HIS INFANCY
CROWNED IN PARIS IN DESPITE OF FOES
AND SHALL THESE LABOURS AND THESE HONOURS DIE
SHALL HENRYS CONQUEST BEDFORDS VIGILANCE
YOUR DEEDS OF WAR AND ALL OUR COUNSEL DIE
O PEERS OF ENGLAND SHAMEFUL IS THIS LEAGUE 
FATAL THIS MARRIAGE CANCELLING YOUR FAME
BLOTTING YOUR NAMES FROM BOOKS OF MEMORY
RAZING THE CHARACTERS OF YOUR RENOWN
DEFACING MONUMENTS OF CONQUERD FRANCE
UNDOING ALL AS ALL HAD NEVER BEEN 
NEPHEW WHAT MEANS THIS PASSIONATE DISCOURSE
THIS PERORATION WITH SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE
FOR FRANCE TIS OURS AND WE WILL KEEP IT STILL 
AY UNCLE WE WILL KEEP IT IF WE CAN
BUT NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WE SHOULD
SUFFOLK THE NEWMADE DUKE THAT RULES THE ROAST
HATH GIVEN THE DUCHY OF ANJOU AND MAINE
UNTO THE POOR KING REIGNIER WHOSE LARGE STYLE
AGREES NOT WITH THE LEANNESS OF HIS PURSE 
NOW BY THE DEATH OF HIM THAT DIED FOR ALL
THESE COUNTIES WERE THE KEYS OF NORMANDY 
BUT WHEREFORE WEEPS WARWICK MY VALIANT SON
FOR GRIEF THAT THEY ARE PAST RECOVERY
FOR WERE THERE HOPE TO CONQUER THEM AGAIN
MY SWORD SHOULD SHED HOT BLOOD MINE EYES NO TEARS 
ANJOU AND MAINE  MYSELF DID WIN THEM BOTH

AND ARE THE CITIES THAT I GOT WITH WOUNDS
DELIVERED UP AGAIN WITH PEACEFUL WORDS
MORT DIEU 
FOR SUFFOLKS DUKE MAY HE BE SUFFOCATE
THAT DIMS THE HONOUR OF THIS WARLIKE ISLE 
FRANCE SHOULD HAVE TORN AND RENT MY VERY HEART
BEFORE I WOULD HAVE YIELDED TO THIS LEAGUE 
I NEVER READ BUT ENGLANDS KINGS HAVE HAD
LARGE SUMS OF GOLD AND DOWRIES WITH THEIR WIVES
AND OUR KING HENRY GIVES AWAY HIS OWN
TO MATCH WITH HER THAT BRINGS NO VANTAGES 
A PROPER JEST AND NEVER HEARD BEFORE
THAT SUFFOLK SHOULD DEMAND A WHOLE FIFTEENTH
FOR COSTS AND CHARGES IN TRANSPORTING HER 
SHE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN FRANCE AND STARVED
IN FRANCE BEFORE 
MY LORD OF GLOUCESTER NOW YE GROW TOO HOT
IT WAS THE PLEASURE OF MY LORD THE KING 
MY LORD OF WINCHESTER I KNOW YOUR MIND
TIS NOT MY SPEECHES THAT YOU DO MISLIKE
BUT TIS MY PRESENCE THAT DOTH TROUBLE YE 
RANCOUR WILL OUT PROUD PRELATE IN THY FACE
I SEE THY FURY IF I LONGER STAY
WE SHALL BEGIN OUR ANCIENT BICKERINGS 
LORDINGS FAREWELL AND SAY WHEN I AM GONE
I PROPHESIED FRANCE WILL BE LOST ERE LONG 
SO THERE GOES OUR PROTECTOR IN A RAGE 
TIS KNOWN TO YOU HE IS MINE ENEMY
NAY MORE AN ENEMY UNTO YOU ALL
AND NO GREAT FRIEND I FEAR ME TO THE KING 
CONSIDER LORDS HE IS THE NEXT OF BLOOD
AND HEIR APPARENT TO THE ENGLISH CROWN
HAD HENRY GOT AN EMPIRE BY HIS MARRIAGE
AND ALL THE WEALTHY KINGDOMS OF THE WEST
THERES REASON HE SHOULD BE DISPLEASED AT IT 
LOOK TO IT LORDS  LET NOT HIS SMOOTHING WORDS
BEWITCH YOUR HEARTS BE WISE AND CIRCUMSPECT 
WHAT THOUGH THE COMMON PEOPLE FAVOUR HIM
CALLING HIM HUMPHREY THE GOOD DUKE OF
GLOUCESTER
CLAPPING THEIR HANDS AND CRYING WITH LOUD VOICE
JESU MAINTAIN YOUR ROYAL EXCELLENCE 
WITH GOD PRESERVE THE GOOD DUKE HUMPHREY 
I FEAR ME LORDS FOR ALL THIS FLATTERING GLOSS
HE WILL BE FOUND A DANGEROUS PROTECTOR 
WHY SHOULD HE THEN PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGN
HE BEING OF AGE TO GOVERN OF HIMSELF
COUSIN OF SOMERSET JOIN YOU WITH ME
AND ALL TOGETHER WITH THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK
WELL QUICKLY HOISE DUKE HUMPHREY FROM HIS SEAT 
THIS WEIGHTY BUSINESS WILL NOT BROOK DELAY
ILL TO THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK PRESENTLY 
COUSIN OF BUCKINGHAM THOUGH HUMPHREYS PRIDE
AND GREATNESS OF HIS PLACE BE GRIEF TO US
YET LET US WATCH THE HAUGHTY CARDINAL
HIS INSOLENCE IS MORE INTOLERABLE
THAN ALL THE PRINCES IN THE LAND BESIDE
IF GLOUCESTER BE DISPLACED HELL BE PROTECTOR 
OR THOU OR I SOMERSET WILL BE PROTECTOR
DESPITE DUKE HUMPHREY OR THE CARDINAL 
PRIDE WENT BEFORE AMBITION FOLLOWS HIM 
WHILE THESE DO LABOUR FOR THEIR OWN PREFERMENT
BEHOVES IT US TO LABOUR FOR THE REALM 
I NEVER SAW BUT HUMPHREY DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
DID BEAR HIM LIKE A NOBLE GENTLEMAN 
OFT HAVE I SEEN THE HAUGHTY CARDINAL
MORE LIKE A SOLDIER THAN A MAN O THE CHURCH
AS STOUT AND PROUD AS HE WERE LORD OF ALL
SWEAR LIKE A RUFFIAN AND DEMEAN HIMSELF
UNLIKE THE RULER OF A COMMONWEAL 
WARWICK MY SON THE COMFORT OF MY AGE
THY DEEDS THY PLAINNESS AND THY HOUSEKEEPING
HATH WON THE GREATEST FAVOUR OF THE COMMONS
EXCEPTING NONE BUT GOOD DUKE HUMPHREY
AND BROTHER YORK THY ACTS IN IRELAND
IN BRINGING THEM TO CIVIL DISCIPLINE
THY LATE EXPLOITS DONE IN THE HEART OF FRANCE
WHEN THOU WERT REGENT FOR OUR SOVEREIGN
HAVE MADE THEE FEARD AND HONOURD OF THE PEOPLE
JOIN WE TOGETHER FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
IN WHAT WE CAN TO BRIDLE AND SUPPRESS
THE PRIDE OF SUFFOLK AND THE CARDINAL
WITH SOMERSETS AND BUCKINGHAMS AMBITION
AND AS WE MAY CHERISH DUKE HUMPHREYS DEEDS
WHILE THEY DO TEND THE PROFIT OF THE LAND 
SO GOD HELP WARWICK AS HE LOVES THE LAND
AND COMMON PROFIT OF HIS COUNTRY 
  AND SO SAYS YORK FOR HE HATH GREATEST CAUSE 
THEN LETS MAKE HASTE AWAY AND LOOK UNTO THE MAIN 
UNTO THE MAIN  O FATHER MAINE IS LOST
THAT MAINE WHICH BY MAIN FORCE WARWICK DID WIN
AND WOULD HAVE KEPT SO LONG AS BREATH DID LAST 
MAIN CHANCE FATHER YOU MEANT BUT I MEANT MAINE
WHICH I WILL WIN FROM FRANCE OR ELSE BE SLAIN
ANJOU AND MAINE ARE GIVEN TO THE FRENCH
PARIS IS LOST THE STATE OF NORMANDY
STANDS ON A TICKLE POINT NOW THEY ARE GONE
SUFFOLK CONCLUDED ON THE ARTICLES
THE PEERS AGREED AND HENRY WAS WELL PLEASED
TO CHANGE TWO DUKEDOMS FOR A DUKES FAIR DAUGHTER 
I CANNOT BLAME THEM ALL WHAT IST TO THEM
TIS THINE THEY GIVE AWAY AND NOT THEIR OWN 
PIRATES MAY MAKE CHEAP PENNYWORTHS OF THEIR PILLAGE
AND PURCHASE FRIENDS AND GIVE TO COURTEZANS
STILL REVELLING LIKE LORDS TILL ALL BE GONE
WHILE AS THE SILLY OWNER OF THE GOODS
WEEPS OVER THEM AND WRINGS HIS HAPLESS HANDS
AND SHAKES HIS HEAD AND TREMBLING STANDS ALOOF
WHILE ALL IS SHARED AND ALL IS BORNE AWAY
READY TO STARVE AND DARE NOT TOUCH HIS OWN
SO YORK MUST SIT AND FRET AND BITE HIS TONGUE
WHILE HIS OWN LANDS ARE BARGAIND FOR AND SOLD 
METHINKS THE REALMS OF ENGLAND FRANCE AND IRELAND
BEAR THAT PROPORTION TO MY FLESH AND BLOOD
AS DID THE FATAL BRAND ALTHAEA BURND
UNTO THE PRINCES HEART OF CALYDON 
ANJOU AND MAINE BOTH GIVEN UNTO THE FRENCH 
COLD NEWS FOR ME FOR I HAD HOPE OF FRANCE
EVEN AS I HAVE OF FERTILE ENGLANDS SOIL 
A DAY WILL COME WHEN YORK SHALL CLAIM HIS OWN
AND THEREFORE I WILL TAKE THE NEVILS PARTS
AND MAKE A SHOW OF LOVE TO PROUD DUKE HUMPHREY
AND WHEN I SPY ADVANTAGE CLAIM THE CROWN
FOR THATS THE GOLDEN MARK I SEEK TO HIT
NOR SHALL PROUD LANCASTER USURP MY RIGHT
NOR HOLD THE SCEPTRE IN HIS CHILDISH FIST
NOR WEAR THE DIADEM UPON HIS HEAD
WHOSE CHURCHLIKE HUMOURS FITS NOT FOR A CROWN 
THEN YORK BE STILL AWHILE TILL TIME DO SERVE
WATCH THOU AND WAKE WHEN OTHERS BE ASLEEP
TO PRY INTO THE SECRETS OF THE STATE
TILL HENRY SURFEITING IN JOYS OF LOVE
WITH HIS NEW BRIDE AND ENGLANDS DEARBOUGHT QUEEN
AND HUMPHREY WITH THE PEERS BE FALLN AT JARS
THEN WILL I RAISE ALOFT THE MILKWHITE ROSE
WITH WHOSE SWEET SMELL THE AIR SHALL BE PERFUMED
AND IN MY STANDARD BEAR THE ARMS OF YORK
TO GRAPPLE WITH THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER
AND FORCE PERFORCE ILL MAKE HIM YIELD THE CROWN
WHOSE BOOKISH RULE HATH PULLD FAIR ENGLAND DOWN 
WHY DROOPS MY LORD LIKE OVERRIPEND CORN
HANGING THE HEAD AT CERES PLENTEOUS LOAD
WHY DOTH THE GREAT DUKE HUMPHREY KNIT HIS BROWS
AS FROWNING AT THE FAVOURS OF THE WORLD
WHY ARE THINE EYES FIXED TO THE SULLEN EARTH
GAZING ON THAT WHICH SEEMS TO DIM THY SIGHT
WHAT SEEST THOU THERE KING HENRYS DIADEM
ENCHASED WITH ALL THE HONOURS OF THE WORLD
IF SO GAZE ON AND GROVEL ON THY FACE
UNTIL THY HEAD BE CIRCLED WITH THE SAME 
PUT FORTH THY HAND REACH AT THE GLORIOUS GOLD 
WHAT IST TOO SHORT ILL LENGTHEN IT WITH MINE
AND HAVING BOTH TOGETHER HEAVED IT UP
WELL BOTH TOGETHER LIFT OUR HEADS TO HEAVEN
AND NEVER MORE ABASE OUR SIGHT SO LOW
AS TO VOUCHSAFE ONE GLANCE UNTO THE GROUND 
O NELL SWEET NELL IF THOU DOST LOVE THY LORD
BANISH THE CANKER OF AMBITIOUS THOUGHTS 
AND MAY THAT THOUGHT WHEN I IMAGINE ILL
AGAINST MY KING AND NEPHEW VIRTUOUS HENRY

WHAT DREAMD MY LORD TELL ME AND ILL REQUITE IT
WITH SWEET REHEARSAL OF MY MORNINGS DREAM 
METHOUGHT THIS STAFF MINE OFFICEBADGE IN COURT

BUT AS I THINK IT WAS BY THE CARDINAL

AND WILLIAM DE LA POLE FIRST DUKE OF SUFFOLK 
THIS WAS MY DREAM WHAT IT DOTH BODE GOD KNOWS 
TUT THIS WAS NOTHING BUT AN ARGUMENT

BUT LIST TO ME MY HUMPHREY MY SWEET DUKE

THY WIFE TOO  THATS SOME WRONG INDEED  WHATS
YOURS WHATS HERE 
AGAINST THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK FOR ENCLOSING THE
COMMONS OF MELFORD  HOW NOW SIR KNAVE 
ALAS SIR I AM BUT A POOR PETITIONER OF OUR WHOLE TOWNSHIP 
  AGAINST MY MASTER THOMAS
HORNER FOR SAYING THAT THE DUKE OF YORK WAS RIGHTFUL
HEIR TO THE CROWN 
WHAT SAYST THOU DID THE DUKE OF YORK SAY HE WAS
RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE CROWN
THAT MY MASTER WAS NO FORSOOTH MY MASTER SAID
THAT HE WAS AND THAT THE KING WAS AN USURPER 
WHO IS THERE
TAKE THIS FELLOW IN AND SEND FOR
HIS MASTER WITH A PURSUIVANT PRESENTLY WELL HEAR
MORE OF YOUR MATTER BEFORE THE KING 
AND AS FOR YOU THAT LOVE TO BE PROTECTED
UNDER THE WINGS OF OUR PROTECTORS GRACE
BEGIN YOUR SUITS ANEW AND SUE TO HIM 
AWAY BASE CULLIONS  SUFFOLK LET THEM GO 
COME LETS BE GONE 
MY LORD OF SUFFOLK SAY IS THIS THE GUISE
IS THIS THE FASHION IN THE COURT OF ENGLAND
IS THIS THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAINS ISLE
AND THIS THE ROYALTY OF ALBIONS KING
WHAT SHALL KING HENRY BE A PUPIL STILL
UNDER THE SURLY GLOUCESTERS GOVERNANCE
AM I A QUEEN IN TITLE AND IN STYLE
AND MUST BE MADE A SUBJECT TO A DUKE
I TELL THEE POLE WHEN IN THE CITY TOURS
THOU RANST A TILT IN HONOUR OF MY LOVE
AND STOLEST AWAY THE LADIES HEARTS OF FRANCE
I THOUGHT KING HENRY HAD RESEMBLED THEE
IN COURAGE COURTSHIP AND PROPORTION
BUT ALL HIS MIND IS BENT TO HOLINESS
TO NUMBER AVEMARIES ON HIS BEADS
HIS CHAMPIONS ARE THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
HIS WEAPONS HOLY SAWS OF SACRED WRIT
HIS STUDY IS HIS TILTYARD AND HIS LOVES
ARE BRAZEN IMAGES OF CANONIZED SAINTS 
I WOULD THE COLLEGE OF THE CARDINALS
WOULD CHOOSE HIM POPE AND CARRY HIM TO ROME
AND SET THE TRIPLE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD
THAT WERE A STATE FIT FOR HIS HOLINESS 
MADAM BE PATIENT AS I WAS CAUSE
YOUR HIGHNESS CAME TO ENGLAND SO WILL I
IN ENGLAND WORK YOUR GRACES FULL CONTENT 
BESIDE THE HAUGHTY PROTECTOR HAVE WE BEAUFORT
THE IMPERIOUS CHURCHMAN SOMERSET BUCKINGHAM
AND GRUMBLING YORK AND NOT THE LEAST OF THESE
BUT CAN DO MORE IN ENGLAND THAN THE KING 
AND HE OF THESE THAT CAN DO MOST OF ALL
CANNOT DO MORE IN ENGLAND THAN THE NEVILS
SALISBURY AND WARWICK ARE NO SIMPLE PEERS 
NOT ALL THESE LORDS DO VEX ME HALF SO MUCH
AS THAT PROUD DAME THE LORD PROTECTORS WIFE 
SHE SWEEPS IT THROUGH THE COURT WITH TROOPS OF LADIES
MORE LIKE AN EMPRESS THAN DUKE HUMPHREYS WIFE
STRANGERS IN COURT DO TAKE HER FOR THE QUEEN
SHE BEARS A DUKES REVENUES ON HER BACK
AND IN HER HEART SHE SCORNS OUR POVERTY
SHALL I NOT LIVE TO BE AVENGED ON HER
CONTEMPTUOUS BASEBORN CALLET AS SHE IS
SHE VAUNTED MONGST HER MINIONS TOTHER DAY
THE VERY TRAIN OF HER WORST WEARING GOWN
WAS BETTER WORTH THAN ALL MY FATHERS LANDS
TILL SUFFOLK GAVE TWO DUKEDOMS FOR HIS DAUGHTER 
MADAM MYSELF HAVE LIMED A BUSH FOR HER
AND PLACED A QUIRE OF SUCH ENTICING BIRDS
THAT SHE WILL LIGHT TO LISTEN TO THE LAYS
AND NEVER MOUNT TO TROUBLE YOU AGAIN 
SO LET HER REST AND MADAM LIST TO ME
FOR I AM BOLD TO COUNSEL YOU IN THIS 
ALTHOUGH WE FANCY NOT THE CARDINAL
YET MUST WE JOIN WITH HIM AND WITH THE LORDS
TILL WE HAVE BROUGHT DUKE HUMPHREY IN DISGRACE 
AS FOR THE DUKE OF YORK THIS LATE COMPLAINT
WILL MAKE BUT LITTLE FOR HIS BENEFIT 
SO ONE BY ONE WELL WEED THEM ALL AT LAST
AND YOU YOURSELF SHALL STEER THE HAPPY HELM 
FOR MY PART NOBLE LORDS I CARE NOT WHICH
OR SOMERSET OR YORK ALLS ONE TO ME 
IF YORK HAVE ILL DEMEAND HIMSELF IN FRANCE
THEN LET HIM BE DENAYD THE REGENTSHIP 
IF SOMERSET BE UNWORTHY OF THE PLACE
LET YORK BE REGENT I WILL YIELD TO HIM 
WHETHER YOUR GRACE BE WORTHY YEA OR NO
DISPUTE NOT THAT YORK IS THE WORTHIER 
AMBITIOUS WARWICK LET THY BETTERS SPEAK 
THE CARDINALS NOT MY BETTER IN THE FIELD 
ALL IN THIS PRESENCE ARE THY BETTERS WARWICK 
WARWICK MAY LIVE TO BE THE BEST OF ALL 
PEACE SON  AND SHOW SOME REASON BUCKINGHAM
WHY SOMERSET SHOULD BE PREFERRED IN THIS 
BECAUSE THE KING FORSOOTH WILL HAVE IT SO 
MADAM THE KING IS OLD ENOUGH HIMSELF
TO GIVE HIS CENSURE THESE ARE NO WOMENS MATTERS 
IF HE BE OLD ENOUGH WHAT NEEDS YOUR GRACE
TO BE PROTECTOR OF HIS EXCELLENCE
MADAM I AM PROTECTOR OF THE REALM
AND AT HIS PLEASURE WILL RESIGN MY PLACE 
RESIGN IT THEN AND LEAVE THINE INSOLENCE 
SINCE THOU WERT KING AS WHO IS KING BUT THOU 
THE COMMONWEALTH HATH DAILY RUN TO WRECK
THE DAUPHIN HATH PREVAILD BEYOND THE SEAS
AND ALL THE PEERS AND NOBLES OF THE REALM
HAVE BEEN AS BONDMEN TO THY SOVEREIGNTY 
THE COMMONS HAST THOU RACKD THE CLERGYS BAGS
ARE LANK AND LEAN WITH THY EXTORTIONS 
THY SUMPTUOUS BUILDINGS AND THY WIFES ATTIRE
HAVE COST A MASS OF PUBLIC TREASURY 
THY CRUELTY IN EXECUTION
UPON OFFENDERS HATH EXCEEDED LAW
AND LEFT THEE TO THE MERCY OF THE LAW 
THEY SALE OF OFFICES AND TOWNS IN FRANCE
IF THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE SUSPECT IS GREAT
WOULD MAKE THEE QUICKLY HOP WITHOUT THY HEAD 
GIVE ME MY FAN WHAT MINION  CAN YE NOT
I CRY YOU MERCY MADAM WAS IT YOU
WAST I  YEA I IT WAS PROUD FRENCHWOMAN
COULD I COME NEAR YOUR BEAUTY WITH MY NAILS
ID SET MY TEN COMMANDMENTS IN YOUR FACE 
SWEET AUNT BE QUIET TWAS AGAINST HER WILL 
AGAINST HER WILL  GOOD KING LOOK TOT IN TIME
SHELL HAMPER THEE AND DANDLE THEE LIKE A BABY
THOUGH IN THIS PLACE MOST MASTER WEAR NO BREECHES
SHE SHALL NOT STRIKE DAME ELEANOR UNREVENGED 
LORD CARDINAL I WILL FOLLOW ELEANOR
AND LISTEN AFTER HUMPHREY HOW HE PROCEEDS
SHES TICKLED NOW HER FUME NEEDS NO SPURS
SHELL GALLOP FAR ENOUGH TO HER DESTRUCTION 
NOW LORDS MY CHOLER BEING OVERBLOWN
WITH WALKING ONCE ABOUT THE QUADRANGLE
I COME TO TALK OF COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS 
AS FOR YOUR SPITEFUL FALSE OBJECTIONS
PROVE THEM AND I LIE OPEN TO THE LAW
BUT GOD IN MERCY SO DEAL WITH MY SOUL
AS I IN DUTY LOVE MY KING AND COUNTRY

FIRST FOR I CANNOT FLATTER THEE IN PRIDE
NEXT IF I BE APPOINTED FOR THE PLACE

WITHOUT DISCHARGE MONEY OR FURNITURE
TILL FRANCE BE WON INTO THE DAUPHINS HANDS
LAST TIME I DANCED ATTENDANCE ON HIS WILL

IN CRAVING YOUR OPINION OF MY TITLE
WHICH IS INFALLIBLE TO ENGLANDS CROWN 
MY LORD I LONG TO HEAR IT AT FULL 
SWEET YORK BEGIN AND IF THY CLAIM BE GOOD

THE SECOND WILLIAM OF HATFIELD AND THE THIRD
LIONEL DUKE OF CLARENCE NEXT TO WHOM
WAS JOHN OF GAUNT THE DUKE OF LANCASTER
THE FIFTH WAS EDMUND LANGLEY DUKE OF YORK
THE SIXTH WAS THOMAS OF WOODSTOCK DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
WILLIAM OF WINDSOR WAS THE SEVENTH AND LAST 
EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE DIED BEFORE HIS FATHER
AND LEFT BEHIND HIM RICHARD HIS ONLY SON

CROWND BY THE NAME OF HENRY THE FOURTH
SEIZED ON THE REALM DEPOSED THE RIGHTFUL KING
SENT HIS POOR QUEEN TO FRANCE FROM WHENCE SHE CAME
AND HIM TO POMFRET WHERE AS ALL YOU KNOW
HARMLESS RICHARD WAS MURDERD TRAITOROUSLY 
FATHER THE DUKE HATH TOLD THE TRUTH
THUS GOT THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER THE CROWN 
WHICH NOW THEY HOLD BY FORCE AND NOT BY RIGHT
FOR RICHARD THE FIRST SONS HEIR BEING DEAD
THE ISSUE OF THE NEXT SON SHOULD HAVE REIGND 
BUT WILLIAM OF HATFIELD DIED WITHOUT AN HEIR 
THE THIRD SON DUKE OF CLARENCE FROM WHOSE LINE
I CLAIMED THE CROWN HAD ISSUE PHILIPPE A DAUGHTER
WHO MARRIED EDMUND MORTIMER EARL OF MARCH
EDMUND HAD ISSUE ROGER EARL OF MARCH

I MUSE MY LORD OF GLOUCESTER IS NOT COME
TIS NOT HIS WONT TO BE THE HINDMOST MAN
WHATEER OCCASION KEEPS HIM FROM US NOW 
CAN YOU NOT SEE OR WILL YE NOT OBSERVE
THE STRANGENESS OF HIS ALTERD COUNTENANCE
WITH WHAT A MAJESTY HE BEARS HIMSELF
HOW INSOLENT OF LATE HE IS BECOME
HOW PROUD HOW PEREMPTORY AND UNLIKE HIMSELF
WE KNOW THE TIME SINCE HE WAS MILD AND AFFABLE
AND IF WE DID BUT GLANCE A FAROFF LOOK
IMMEDIATELY HE WAS UPON HIS KNEE
THAT ALL THE COURT ADMIRED HIM FOR SUBMISSION
BUT MEET HIM NOW AND BE IT IN THE MORN
WHEN EVERY ONE WILL GIVE THE TIME OF DAY
HE KNITS HIS BROW AND SHOWS AN ANGRY EYE
AND PASSETH BY WITH STIFF UNBOWED KNEE
DISDAINING DUTY THAT TO US BELONGS 
SMALL CURS ARE NOT REGARDED WHEN THEY GRIN
BUT GREAT MEN TREMBLE WHEN THE LION ROARS
AND HUMPHREY IS NO LITTLE MAN IN ENGLAND 
FIRST NOTE THAT HE IS NEAR YOU IN DESCENT
AND SHOULD YOU FALL HE AS THE NEXT WILL MOUNT 
ME SEEMETH THEN IT IS NO POLICY
RESPECTING WHAT A RANCOROUS MIND HE BEARS
AND HIS ADVANTAGE FOLLOWING YOUR DECEASE
THAT HE SHOULD COME ABOUT YOUR ROYAL PERSON
OR BE ADMITTED TO YOUR HIGHNESS COUNCIL 
BY FLATTERY HATH HE WON THE COMMONS HEARTS
AND WHEN HE PLEASE TO MAKE COMMOTION
TIS TO BE FEARD THEY ALL WILL FOLLOW HIM 
NOW TIS THE SPRING AND WEEDS ARE SHALLOWROOTED
SUFFER THEM NOW AND THEYLL OERGROW THE GARDEN
AND CHOKE THE HERBS FOR WANT OF HUSBANDRY 
THE REVERENT CARE I BEAR UNTO MY LORD
MADE ME COLLECT THESE DANGERS IN THE DUKE 
IF IT BE FOND CALL IT A WOMANS FEAR
WHICH FEAR IF BETTER REASONS CAN SUPPLANT
I WILL SUBSCRIBE AND SAY I WRONGD THE DUKE 
MY LORD OF SUFFOLK BUCKINGHAM AND YORK
REPROVE MY ALLEGATION IF YOU CAN
OR ELSE CONCLUDE MY WORDS EFFECTUAL 
WELL HATH YOUR HIGHNESS SEEN INTO THIS DUKE
AND HAD I FIRST BEEN PUT TO SPEAK MY MIND
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOUR GRACES TALE 
THE DUCHESS BY HIS SUBORNATION
UPON MY LIFE BEGAN HER DEVILISH PRACTISES
OR IF HE WERE NOT PRIVY TO THOSE FAULTS
YET BY REPUTING OF HIS HIGH DESCENT
AS NEXT THE KING HE WAS SUCCESSIVE HEIR
AND SUCH HIGH VAUNTS OF HIS NOBILITY
DID INSTIGATE THE BEDLAM BRAINSICK DUCHESS
BY WICKED MEANS TO FRAME OUR SOVEREIGNS FALL 
SMOOTH RUNS THE WATER WHERE THE BROOK IS DEEP
AND IN HIS SIMPLE SHOW HE HARBOURS TREASON 
THE FOX BARKS NOT WHEN HE WOULD STEAL THE LAMB 
NO NO MY SOVEREIGN GLOUCESTER IS A MAN
UNSOUNDED YET AND FULL OF DEEP DECEIT 
DID HE NOT CONTRARY TO FORM OF LAW
DEVISE STRANGE DEATHS FOR SMALL OFFENCES DONE
AND DID HE NOT IN HIS PROTECTORSHIP
LEVY GREAT SUMS OF MONEY THROUGH THE REALM
FOR SOLDIERS PAY IN FRANCE AND NEVER SENT IT
BY MEANS WHEREOF THE TOWNS EACH DAY REVOLTED 
TUT THESE ARE PETTY FAULTS TO FAULTS UNKNOWN 
WHICH TIME WILL BRING TO LIGHT IN SMOOTH
DUKE HUMPHREY 
MY LORDS AT ONCE THE CARE YOU HAVE OF US
TO MOW DOWN THORNS THAT WOULD ANNOY OUR FOOT
IS WORTHY PRAISE BUT SHALL I SPEAK MY CONSCIENCE
OUR KINSMAN GLOUCESTER IS AS INNOCENT
FROM MEANING TREASON TO OUR ROYAL PERSON
AS IS THE SUCKING LAMB OR HARMLESS DOVE
THE DUKE IS VIRTUOUS MILD AND TOO WELL GIVEN
TO DREAM ON EVIL OR TO WORK MY DOWNFALL 
AH WHATS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THIS FOND AFFIANCE 
SEEMS HE A DOVE HIS FEATHERS ARE BUT BORROWED
FOR HES DISPOSED AS THE HATEFUL RAVEN
IS HE A LAMB HIS SKIN IS SURELY LENT HIM
FOR HES INCLINED AS IS THE RAVENOUS WOLF 
WHO CANNOT STEAL A SHAPE THAT MEANS DECEIT
TAKE HEED MY LORD THE WELFARE OF US ALL
HANGS ON THE CUTTING SHORT THAT FRAUDFUL MAN 
ALL HEALTH UNTO MY GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN 
WELCOME LORD SOMERSET  WHAT NEWS FROM FRANCE
THAT ALL YOUR INTEREST IN THOSE TERRITORIES
IS UTTERLY BEREFT YOU ALL IS LOST 
COLD NEWS LORD SOMERSET BUT GODS WILL BE DONE 
  COLD NEWS FOR ME FOR I HAD HOPE OF FRANCE
AS FIRMLY AS I HOPE FOR FERTILE ENGLAND 
THUS ARE MY BLOSSOMS BLASTED IN THE BUD
AND CATERPILLARS EAT MY LEAVES AWAY
BUT I WILL REMEDY THIS GEAR ERE LONG
OR SELL MY TITLE FOR A GLORIOUS GRAVE 
ALL HAPPINESS UNTO MY LORD THE KING 
PARDON MY LIEGE THAT I HAVE STAYD SO LONG 
NAY GLOUCESTER KNOW THAT THOU ART COME TOO SOON
UNLESS THOU WERT MORE LOYAL THAN THOU ART
I DO ARREST THEE OF HIGH TREASON HERE 
WELL SUFFOLK THOU SHALT NOT SEE ME BLUSH
NOR CHANGE MY COUNTENANCE FOR THIS ARREST
A HEART UNSPOTTED IS NOT EASILY DAUNTED 
THE PUREST SPRING IS NOT SO FREE FROM MUD
AS I AM CLEAR FROM TREASON TO MY SOVEREIGN
WHO CAN ACCUSE ME WHEREIN AM I GUILTY
TIS THOUGHT MY LORD THAT YOU TOOK BRIBES OF FRANCE
AND BEING PROTECTOR STAYED THE SOLDIERS PAY
BY MEANS WHEREOF HIS HIGHNESS HATH LOST FRANCE 
IS IT BUT THOUGHT SO WHAT ARE THEY THAT THINK IT
I NEVER ROBBD THE SOLDIERS OF THEIR PAY
NOR EVER HAD ONE PENNY BRIBE FROM FRANCE 
SO HELP ME GOD AS I HAVE WATCHD THE NIGHT
AY NIGHT BY NIGHT IN STUDYING GOOD FOR ENGLAND
THAT DOIT THAT EER I WRESTED FROM THE KING
OR ANY GROAT I HOARDED TO MY USE
BE BROUGHT AGAINST ME AT MY TRIALDAY 
NO MANY A POUND OF MINE OWN PROPER STORE
BECAUSE I WOULD NOT TAX THE NEEDY COMMONS
HAVE I DISBURSED TO THE GARRISONS
AND NEVER ASKD FOR RESTITUTION 
IT SERVES YOU WELL MY LORD TO SAY SO MUCH 
I SAY NO MORE THAN TRUTH SO HELP ME GOD 
IN YOUR PROTECTORSHIP YOU DID DEVISE
STRANGE TORTURES FOR OFFENDERS NEVER HEARD OF
THAT ENGLAND WAS DEFAMED BY TYRANNY 
WHY TIS WELL KNOWN THAT WHILES I WAS
PROTECTOR
PITY WAS ALL THE FAULT THAT WAS IN ME
FOR I SHOULD MELT AT AN OFFENDERS TEARS
AND LOWLY WORDS WERE RANSOM FOR THEIR FAULT 
UNLESS IT WERE A BLOODY MURDERER
OR FOUL FELONIOUS THIEF THAT FLEECED POOR PASSENGERS
I NEVER GAVE THEM CONDIGN PUNISHMENT
MURDER INDEED THAT BLOODY SIN I TORTURED
ABOVE THE FELON OR WHAT TRESPASS ELSE 
MY LORD THESE FAULTS ARE EASY QUICKLY ANSWERED
BUT MIGHTIER CRIMES ARE LAID UNTO YOUR CHARGE
WHEREOF YOU CANNOT EASILY PURGE YOURSELF 
I DO ARREST YOU IN HIS HIGHNESS NAME
AND HERE COMMIT YOU TO MY LORD CARDINAL
TO KEEP UNTIL YOUR FURTHER TIME OF TRIAL 
MY LORD OF GLOUCESTER TIS MY SPECIAL HOPE
THAT YOU WILL CLEAR YOURSELF FROM ALL SUSPECT
MY CONSCIENCE TELLS ME YOU ARE INNOCENT 
AH GRACIOUS LORD THESE DAYS ARE DANGEROUS
VIRTUE IS CHOKED WITH FOUL AMBITION
AND CHARITY CHASED HENCE BY RANCOURS HAND
FOUL SUBORNATION IS PREDOMINANT
AND EQUITY EXILED YOUR HIGHNESS LAND 
I KNOW THEIR COMPLOT IS TO HAVE MY LIFE
AND IF MY DEATH MIGHT MAKE THIS ISLAND HAPPY
AND PROVE THE PERIOD OF THEIR TYRANNY
I WOULD EXPEND IT WITH ALL WILLINGNESS
BUT MINE IS MADE THE PROLOGUE TO THEIR PLAY
FOR THOUSANDS MORE THAT YET SUSPECT NO PERIL
WILL NOT CONCLUDE THEIR PLOTTED TRAGEDY 
BEAUFORTS RED SPARKLING EYES BLAB HIS HEARTS MALICE
AND SUFFOLKS CLOUDY BROW HIS STORMY HATE
SHARP BUCKINGHAM UNBURTHENS WITH HIS TONGUE
THE ENVIOUS LOAD THAT LIES UPON HIS HEART
AND DOGGED YORK THAT REACHES AT THE MOON
WHOSE OVERWEENING ARM I HAVE PLUCKD BACK
BY FALSE ACCUSE DOTH LEVEL AT MY LIFE
AND YOU MY SOVEREIGN LADY WITH THE REST
CAUSELESS HAVE LAID DISGRACES ON MY HEAD
AND WITH YOUR BEST ENDEAVOUR HAVE STIRRD UP
MY LIEFEST LIEGE TO BE MINE ENEMY
AY ALL YOU HAVE LAID YOUR HEADS TOGETHER 
MYSELF HAD NOTICE OF YOUR CONVENTICLES 
AND ALL TO MAKE AWAY MY GUILTLESS LIFE 
I SHALL NOT WANT FALSE WITNESS TO CONDEMN ME
NOR STORE OF TREASONS TO AUGMENT MY GUILT
THE ANCIENT PROVERB WILL BE WELL EFFECTED
A STAFF IS QUICKLY FOUND TO BEAT A DOG 
MY LIEGE HIS RAILING IS INTOLERABLE
IF THOSE THAT CARE TO KEEP YOUR ROYAL PERSON
FROM TREASONS SECRET KNIFE AND TRAITORS RAGE
BE THUS UPBRAIDED CHID AND RATED AT
AND THE OFFENDER GRANTED SCOPE OF SPEECH
TWILL MAKE THEM COOL IN ZEAL UNTO YOUR GRACE 
HATH HE NOT TWIT OUR SOVEREIGN LADY HERE
WITH IGNOMINIOUS WORDS THOUGH CLERKLY COUCHD
AS IF SHE HAD SUBORNED SOME TO SWEAR
FALSE ALLEGATIONS TO OERTHROW HIS STATE
BUT I CAN GIVE THE LOSER LEAVE TO CHIDE 
FAR TRUER SPOKE THAN MEANT I LOSE INDEED
BESHREW THE WINNERS FOR THEY PLAYD ME FALSE 
AND WELL SUCH LOSERS MAY HAVE LEAVE TO SPEAK 
HELL WREST THE SENSE AND HOLD US HERE ALL DAY
LORD CARDINAL HE IS YOUR PRISONER 
SIRS TAKE AWAY THE DUKE AND GUARD HIM SURE 
AH  THUS KING HENRY THROWS AWAY HIS CRUTCH
BEFORE HIS LEGS BE FIRM TO BEAR HIS BODY 
THUS IS THE SHEPHERD BEATEN FROM THY SIDE
AND WOLVES ARE GNARLING WHO SHALL GNAW THEE FIRST 
AH THAT MY FEAR WERE FALSE  AH THAT IT WERE 
FOR GOOD KING HENRY THY DECAY I FEAR 
MY LORDS WHAT TO YOUR WISDOMS SEEMETH BEST
DO OR UNDO AS IF OURSELF WERE HERE 
WHAT WILL YOUR HIGHNESS LEAVE THE PARLIAMENT
AY MARGARET MY HEART IS DROWND WITH GRIEF
WHOSE FLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW WITHIN MINE EYES
MY BODY ROUND ENGIRT WITH MISERY
FOR WHATS MORE MISERABLE THAN DISCONTENT
AH UNCLE HUMPHREY  IN THY FACE I SEE
THE MAP OF HONOUR TRUTH AND LOYALTY
AND YET GOOD HUMPHREY IS THE HOUR TO COME
THAT EER I PROVED THEE FALSE OR FEARD THY FAITH 
WHAT LOURING STAR NOW ENVIES THY ESTATE
THAT THESE GREAT LORDS AND MARGARET OUR QUEEN
DO SEEK SUBVERSION OF THY HARMLESS LIFE
THOU NEVER DIDST THEM WRONG NOR NO MAN WRONG
AND AS THE BUTCHER TAKES AWAY THE CALF
AND BINDS THE WRETCH AND BEATS IT WHEN IT STRAYS
BEARING IT TO THE BLOODY SLAUGHTERHOUSE
EVEN SO REMORSELESS HAVE THEY BORNE HIM HENCE
AND AS THE DAM RUNS LOWING UP AND DOWN
LOOKING THE WAY HER HARMLESS YOUNG ONE WENT
AND CAN DO NOUGHT BUT WAIL HER DARLINGS LOSS
EVEN SO MYSELF BEWAILS GOOD GLOUCESTERS CASE
WITH SAD UNHELPFUL TEARS AND WITH DIMMD EYES
LOOK AFTER HIM AND CANNOT DO HIM GOOD
SO MIGHTY ARE HIS VOWED ENEMIES 
HIS FORTUNES I WILL WEEP AND TWIXT EACH GROAN
SAY WHOS A TRAITOR GLOUCESTER HE IS NONE 
FREE LORDS COLD SNOW MELTS WITH THE SUNS HOT BEAMS 
HENRY MY LORD IS COLD IN GREAT AFFAIRS
TOO FULL OF FOOLISH PITY AND GLOUCESTERS SHOW
BEGUILES HIM AS THE MOURNFUL CROCODILE
WITH SORROW SNARES RELENTING PASSENGERS
OR AS THE SNAKE ROLLD IN A FLOWERING BANK
WITH SHINING CHEQUERD SLOUGH DOTH STING A CHILD
THAT FOR THE BEAUTY THINKS IT EXCELLENT 
BELIEVE ME LORDS WERE NONE MORE WISE THAN I 
AND YET HEREIN I JUDGE MINE OWN WIT GOOD 
THIS GLOUCESTER SHOULD BE QUICKLY RID THE WORLD
TO RID US OF THE FEAR WE HAVE OF HIM 
THAT HE SHOULD DIE IS WORTHY POLICY
BUT YET WE WANT A COLOUR FOR HIS DEATH
TIS MEET HE BE CONDEMND BY COURSE OF LAW 
BUT IN MY MIND THAT WERE NO POLICY
THE KING WILL LABOUR STILL TO SAVE HIS LIFE
THE COMMONS HAPLY RISE TO SAVE HIS LIFE
AND YET WE HAVE BUT TRIVIAL ARGUMENT
MORE THAN MISTRUST THAT SHOWS HIM WORTHY DEATH 
SO THAT BY THIS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HIM DIE 
AH YORK NO MAN ALIVE SO FAIN AS I 
TIS YORK THAT HATH MORE REASON FOR HIS DEATH 
BUT MY LORD CARDINAL AND YOU MY LORD OF SUFFOLK
SAY AS YOU THINK AND SPEAK IT FROM YOUR SOULS
WERET NOT ALL ONE AN EMPTY EAGLE WERE SET
TO GUARD THE CHICKEN FROM A HUNGRY KITE
AS PLACE DUKE HUMPHREY FOR THE KINGS PROTECTOR
SO THE POOR CHICKEN SHOULD BE SURE OF DEATH 
MADAM TIS TRUE AND WERET NOT MADNESS THEN
TO MAKE THE FOX SURVEYOR OF THE FOLD
WHO BEING ACCUSED A CRAFTY MURDERER
HIS GUILT SHOULD BE BUT IDLY POSTED OVER
BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE IS NOT EXECUTED 
NO LET HIM DIE IN THAT HE IS A FOX
BY NATURE PROVED AN ENEMY TO THE FLOCK
BEFORE HIS CHAPS BE STAIND WITH CRIMSON BLOOD
AS HUMPHREY PROVED BY REASONS TO MY LIEGE 
AND DO NOT STAND ON QUILLETS HOW TO SLAY HIM
BE IT BY GINS BY SNARES BY SUBTLETY
SLEEPING OR WAKING TIS NO MATTER HOW
SO HE BE DEAD FOR THAT IS GOOD DECEIT
WHICH MATES HIM FIRST THAT FIRST INTENDS DECEIT 
THRICENOBLE SUFFOLK TIS RESOLUTELY SPOKE 
NOT RESOLUTE EXCEPT SO MUCH WERE DONE
FOR THINGS ARE OFTEN SPOKE AND SELDOM MEANT
BUT THAT MY HEART ACCORDETH WITH MY TONGUE
SEEING THE DEED IS MERITORIOUS
AND TO PRESERVE MY SOVEREIGN FROM HIS FOE
SAY BUT THE WORD AND I WILL BE HIS PRIEST 
BUT I WOULD HAVE HIM DEAD MY LORD OF SUFFOLK
ERE YOU CAN TAKE DUE ORDERS FOR A PRIEST

AND THIS FELL TEMPEST SHALL NOT CEASE TO RAGE
UNTIL THE GOLDEN CIRCUIT ON MY HEAD

DO CALM THE FURY OF THIS MADBRED FLAW 
AND FOR A MINISTER OF MY INTENT
I HAVE SEDUCED A HEADSTRONG KENTISHMAN
JOHN CADE OF ASHFORD
TO MAKE COMMOTION AS FULL WELL HE CAN
UNDER THE TITLE OF JOHN MORTIMER 
IN IRELAND HAVE I SEEN THIS STUBBORN CADE
OPPOSE HIMSELF AGAINST A TROOP OF KERNS
AND FOUGHT SO LONG TILL THAT HIS THIGHS WITH DARTS
WERE ALMOST LIKE A SHARPQUILLD PORPENTINE
AND IN THE END BEING RESCUED I HAVE SEEN
HIM CAPER UPRIGHT LIKE A WILD MORISCO
SHAKING THE BLOODY DARTS AS HE HIS BELLS 
FULL OFTEN LIKE A SHAGHAIRD CRAFTY KERN
HATH HE CONVERSED WITH THE ENEMY
AND UNDISCOVERD COME TO ME AGAIN
AND GIVEN ME NOTICE OF THEIR VILLANIES 
THIS DEVIL HERE SHALL BE MY SUBSTITUTE
FOR THAT JOHN MORTIMER WHICH NOW IS DEAD
IN FACE IN GAIT IN SPEECH HE DOTH RESEMBLE
BY THIS I SHALL PERCEIVE THE COMMONS MIND
HOW THEY AFFECT THE HOUSE AND CLAIM OF YORK 
SAY HE BE TAKEN RACKD AND TORTURED
I KNOW NO PAIN THEY CAN INFLICT UPON HIM
WILL MAKE HIM SAY I MOVED HIM TO THOSE ARMS 
SAY THAT HE THRIVE AS TIS GREAT LIKE HE WILL
WHY THEN FROM IRELAND COME I WITH MY STRENGTH

HE DOTH REVIVE AGAIN MADAM BE PATIENT 
O HEAVENLY GOD 
HOW FARES MY GRACIOUS LORD

WHAT DOTH MY LORD OF SUFFOLK COMFORT ME
CAME HE RIGHT NOW TO SING A RAVENS NOTE
WHOSE DISMAL TUNE BEREFT MY VITAL POWERS
AND THINKS HE THAT THE CHIRPING OF A WREN
BY CRYING COMFORT FROM A HOLLOW BREAST
CAN CHASE AWAY THE FIRSTCONCEIVED SOUND
HIDE NOT THY POISON WITH SUCH SUGARD WORDS
LAY NOT THY HANDS ON ME FORBEAR I SAY
THEIR TOUCH AFFRIGHTS ME AS A SERPENTS STING 
THOU BALEFUL MESSENGER OUT OF MY SIGHT 
UPON THY EYEBALLS MURDEROUS TYRANNY
SITS IN GRIM MAJESTY TO FRIGHT THE WORLD 
LOOK NOT UPON ME FOR THINE EYES ARE WOUNDING
YET DO NOT GO AWAY COME BASILISK
AND KILL THE INNOCENT GAZER WITH THY SIGHT
FOR IN THE SHADE OF DEATH I SHALL FIND JOY
IN LIFE BUT DOUBLE DEATH NOW GLOUCESTERS DEAD 
WHY DO YOU RATE MY LORD OF SUFFOLK THUS
ALTHOUGH THE DUKE WAS ENEMY TO HIM
YET HE MOST CHRISTIANLIKE LAMENTS HIS DEATH
AND FOR MYSELF FOE AS HE WAS TO ME
MIGHT LIQUID TEARS OR HEARTOFFENDING GROANS
OR BLOODCONSUMING SIGHS RECALL HIS LIFE
I WOULD BE BLIND WITH WEEPING SICK WITH GROANS
LOOK PALE AS PRIMROSE WITH BLOODDRINKING SIGHS
AND ALL TO HAVE THE NOBLE DUKE ALIVE 
WHAT KNOW I HOW THE WORLD MAY DEEM OF ME
FOR IT IS KNOWN WE WERE BUT HOLLOW FRIENDS
IT MAY BE JUDGED I MADE THE DUKE AWAY
SO SHALL MY NAME WITH SLANDERS TONGUE BE WOUNDED
AND PRINCES COURTS BE FILLD WITH MY REPROACH 
THIS GET I BY HIS DEATH AY ME UNHAPPY 
TO BE A QUEEN AND CROWND WITH INFAMY 
AH WOE IS ME FOR GLOUCESTER WRETCHED MAN 
BE WOE FOR ME MORE WRETCHED THAN HE IS 
WHAT DOST THOU TURN AWAY AND HIDE THY FACE
I AM NO LOATHSOME LEPER LOOK ON ME 
WHAT  ART THOU LIKE THE ADDER WAXEN DEAF
BE POISONOUS TOO AND KILL THY FORLORN QUEEN 
IS ALL THY COMFORT SHUT IN GLOUCESTERS TOMB
WHY THEN DAME MARGARET WAS NEER THY JOY 
ERECT HIS STATUE AND WORSHIP IT
AND MAKE MY IMAGE BUT AN ALEHOUSE SIGN 
WAS I FOR THIS NIGH WRECKD UPON THE SEA
AND TWICE BY AWKWARD WIND FROM ENGLANDS BANK
DROVE BACK AGAIN UNTO MY NATIVE CLIME
WHAT BODED THIS BUT WELL FOREWARNING WIND
DID SEEM TO SAY SEEK NOT A SCORPIONS NEST
NOR SET NO FOOTING ON THIS UNKIND SHORE
WHAT DID I THEN BUT CURSED THE GENTLE GUSTS
AND HE THAT LOOSED THEM FORTH THEIR BRAZEN CAVES
AND BID THEM BLOW TOWARDS ENGLANDS BLESSED SHORE
OR TURN OUR STERN UPON A DREADFUL ROCK
YET AEOLUS WOULD NOT BE A MURDERER
BUT LEFT THAT HATEFUL OFFICE UNTO THEE
THE PRETTYVAULTING SEA REFUSED TO DROWN ME
KNOWING THAT THOU WOULDST HAVE ME DROWND ON SHORE
WITH TEARS AS SALT AS SEA THROUGH THY UNKINDNESS
THE SPLITTING ROCKS COWERD IN THE SINKING SANDS
AND WOULD NOT DASH ME WITH THEIR RAGGED SIDES
BECAUSE THY FLINTY HEART MORE HARD THAN THEY
MIGHT IN THY PALACE PERISH MARGARET 
AS FAR AS I COULD KEN THY CHALKY CLIFFS
WHEN FROM THY SHORE THE TEMPEST BEAT US BACK
I STOOD UPON THE HATCHES IN THE STORM
AND WHEN THE DUSKY SKY BEGAN TO ROB
MY EARNESTGAPING SIGHT OF THY LANDS VIEW
I TOOK A COSTLY JEWEL FROM MY NECK
A HEART IT WAS BOUND IN WITH DIAMONDS
AND THREW IT TOWARDS THY LAND THE SEA RECEIVED IT
AND SO I WISHD THY BODY MIGHT MY HEART
AND EVEN WITH THIS I LOST FAIR ENGLANDS VIEW
AND BID MINE EYES BE PACKING WITH MY HEART
AND CALLD THEM BLIND AND DUSKY SPECTACLES
FOR LOSING KEN OF ALBIONS WISHED COAST 
HOW OFTEN HAVE I TEMPTED SUFFOLKS TONGUE
THE AGENT OF THY FOUL INCONSTANCY
TO SIT AND WITCH ME AS ASCANIUS DID
WHEN HE TO MADDING DIDO WOULD UNFOLD
HIS FATHERS ACTS COMMENCED IN BURNING TROY 
AM I NOT WITCHD LIKE HER OR THOU NOT FALSE LIKE HIM
AY ME I CAN NO MORE  DIE MARGARET 
FOR HENRY WEEPS THAT THOU DOST LIVE SO LONG 
IT IS REPORTED MIGHTY SOVEREIGN
THAT GOOD DUKE HUMPHREY TRAITOROUSLY IS MURDERD
BY SUFFOLK AND THE CARDINAL BEAUFORTS MEANS 
THE COMMONS LIKE AN ANGRY HIVE OF BEES
THAT WANT THEIR LEADER SCATTER UP AND DOWN
AND CARE NOT WHO THEY STING IN HIS REVENGE 
MYSELF HAVE CALMD THEIR SPLEENFUL MUTINY
UNTIL THEY HEAR THE ORDER OF HIS DEATH 
THAT HE IS DEAD GOOD WARWICK TIS TOO TRUE
BUT HOW HE DIED GOD KNOWS NOT HENRY
ENTER HIS CHAMBER VIEW HIS BREATHLESS CORPSE
AND COMMENT THEN UPON HIS SUDDEN DEATH 
THAT SHALL I DO MY LIEGE  STAY SALISBURY
WITH THE RUDE MULTITUDE TILL I RETURN 
O THOU THAT JUDGEST ALL THINGS STAY MY THOUGHTS
MY THOUGHTS THAT LABOUR TO PERSUADE MY SOUL
SOME VIOLENT HANDS WERE LAID ON HUMPHREYS LIFE 
IF MY SUSPECT BE FALSE FORGIVE ME GOD
FOR JUDGMENT ONLY DOTH BELONG TO THEE 
FAIN WOULD I GO TO CHAFE HIS PALY LIPS
WITH TWENTY THOUSAND KISSES AND TO DRAIN
UPON HIS FACE AN OCEAN OF SALT TEARS
TO TELL MY LOVE UNTO HIS DUMB DEAF TRUNK
AND WITH MY FINGERS FEEL HIS HAND UNFEELING
BUT ALL IN VAIN ARE THESE MEAN OBSEQUIES
AND TO SURVEY HIS DEAD AND EARTHLY IMAGE
WHAT WERE IT BUT TO MAKE MY SORROW GREATER
COME HITHER GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN VIEW THIS BODY 
THAT IS TO SEE HOW DEEP MY GRAVE IS MADE
FOR WITH HIS SOUL FLED ALL MY WORLDLY SOLACE
FOR SEEING HIM I SEE MY LIFE IN DEATH 
AS SURELY AS MY SOUL INTENDS TO LIVE
WITH THAT DREAD KING THAT TOOK OUR STATE UPON HIM
TO FREE US FROM HIS FATHERS WRATHFUL CURSE
I DO BELIEVE THAT VIOLENT HANDS WERE LAID
UPON THE LIFE OF THIS THRICEFAMED DUKE 
A DREADFUL OATH SWORN WITH A SOLEMN TONGUE 
WHAT INSTANCE GIVES LORD WARWICK FOR HIS VOW
SEE HOW THE BLOOD IS SETTLED IN HIS FACE 
OFT HAVE I SEEN A TIMELYPARTED GHOST
OF ASHY SEMBLANCE MEAGRE PALE AND BLOODLESS
BEING ALL DESCENDED TO THE LABOURING HEART
WHO IN THE CONFLICT THAT IT HOLDS WITH DEATH
ATTRACTS THE SAME FOR AIDANCE GAINST THE ENEMY
WHICH WITH THE HEART THERE COOLS AND NEER RETURNETH
TO BLUSH AND BEAUTIFY THE CHEEK AGAIN 
BUT SEE HIS FACE IS BLACK AND FULL OF BLOOD
HIS EYEBALLS FURTHER OUT THAN WHEN HE LIVED
STARING FULL GHASTLY LIKE A STRANGLED MAN
HIS HAIR UPREARD HIS NOSTRILS STRETCHED WITH STRUGGLING
HIS HANDS ABROAD DISPLAYD AS ONE THAT GRASPD
AND TUGGD FOR LIFE AND WAS BY STRENGTH SUBDUED
LOOK ON THE SHEETS HIS HAIR YOU SEE IS STICKING
HIS WELLPROPORTIOND BEARD MADE ROUGH AND RUGGED
LIKE TO THE SUMMERS CORN BY TEMPEST LODGED 
IT CANNOT BE BUT HE WAS MURDERD HERE
THE LEAST OF ALL THESE SIGNS WERE PROBABLE 
WHY WARWICK WHO SHOULD DO THE DUKE TO DEATH
MYSELF AND BEAUFORT HAD HIM IN PROTECTION
AND WE I HOPE SIR ARE NO MURDERERS 
BUT BOTH OF YOU WERE VOWD DUKE HUMPHREYS FOES
AND YOU FORSOOTH HAD THE GOOD DUKE TO KEEP
TIS LIKE YOU WOULD NOT FEAST HIM LIKE A FRIEND
AND TIS WELL SEEN HE FOUND AN ENEMY 
THEN YOU BELIKE SUSPECT THESE NOBLEMEN
AS GUILTY OF DUKE HUMPHREYS TIMELESS DEATH 
WHO FINDS THE HEIFER DEAD AND BLEEDING FRESH
AND SEES FAST BY A BUTCHER WITH AN AXE
BUT WILL SUSPECT TWAS HE THAT MADE THE SLAUGHTER
WHO FINDS THE PARTRIDGE IN THE PUTTOCKS NEST
BUT MAY IMAGINE HOW THE BIRD WAS DEAD
ALTHOUGH THE KITE SOAR WITH UNBLOODIED BEAK
EVEN SO SUSPICIOUS IS THIS TRAGEDY 
ARE YOU THE BUTCHER SUFFOLK WHERES YOUR KNIFE
IS BEAUFORT TERMD A KITE WHERE ARE HIS TALONS
I WEAR NO KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER SLEEPING MEN
BUT HERES A VENGEFUL SWORD RUSTED WITH EASE
THAT SHALL BE SCOURED IN HIS RANCOROUS HEART
THAT SLANDERS ME WITH MURDERS CRIMSON BADGE 
SAY IF THOU DAREST PROUD LORD OF WARWICKSHIRE
THAT I AM FAULTY IN DUKE HUMPHREYS DEATH 
WHAT DARES NOT WARWICK IF FALSE SUFFOLK DARE HIM
HE DARES NOT CALM HIS CONTUMELIOUS SPIRIT
NOR CEASE TO BE AN ARROGANT CONTROLLER
THOUGH SUFFOLK DARE HIM TWENTY THOUSAND TIMES 
MADAM BE STILL WITH REVERENCE MAY I SAY
FOR EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK IN HIS BEHALF
IS SLANDER TO YOUR ROYAL DIGNITY 
BLUNTWITTED LORD IGNOBLE IN DEMEANOR 
IF EVER LADY WRONGD HER LORD SO MUCH
THY MOTHER TOOK INTO HER BLAMEFUL BED
SOME STERN UNTUTORD CHURL AND NOBLE STOCK
WAS GRAFT WITH CRABTREE SLIP WHOSE FRUIT THOU ART
AND NEVER OF THE NEVILS NOBLE RACE 
BUT THAT THE GUILT OF MURDER BUCKLERS THEE
AND I SHOULD ROB THE DEATHSMAN OF HIS FEE
QUITTING THEE THEREBY OF TEN THOUSAND SHAMES
AND THAT MY SOVEREIGNS PRESENCE MAKES ME MILD
I WOULD FALSE MURDEROUS COWARD ON THY KNEE
MAKE THEE BEG PARDON FOR THY PASSED SPEECH
AND SAY IT WAS THY MOTHER THAT THOU MEANTST
THAT THOU THYSELF WAS BORN IN BASTARDY
AND AFTER ALL THIS FEARFUL HOMAGE DONE
GIVE THEE THY HIRE AND SEND THY SOUL TO HELL
PERNICIOUS BLOODSUCKER OF SLEEPING MEN 
THOU SHALL BE WAKING WELL I SHED THY BLOOD
IF FROM THIS PRESENCE THOU DAREST GO WITH ME 
AWAY EVEN NOW OR I WILL DRAG THEE HENCE
UNWORTHY THOUGH THOU ART ILL COPE WITH THEE
AND DO SOME SERVICE TO DUKE HUMPHREYS GHOST 
WHAT STRONGER BREASTPLATE THAN A HEART UNTAINTED 
THRICE IS HE ARMED THAT HATH HIS QUARREL JUST
AND HE BUT NAKED THOUGH LOCKD UP IN STEEL
WHOSE CONSCIENCE WITH INJUSTICE IS CORRUPTED 
WHAT NOISE IS THIS
WHY HOW NOW LORDS  YOUR WRATHFUL WEAPONS DRAWN
HERE IN OUR PRESENCE  DARE YOU BE SO BOLD
WHY WHAT TUMULTUOUS CLAMOUR HAVE WE HERE
THE TRAITOROUS WARWICK WITH THE MEN OF BURY
SET ALL UPON ME MIGHTY SOVEREIGN 
  SIRS STAND APART
THE KING SHALL KNOW YOUR MIND 
DREAD LORD THE COMMONS SEND YOU WORD BY ME
UNLESS LORD SUFFOLK STRAIGHT BE DONE TO DEATH
OR BANISHED FAIR ENGLANDS TERRITORIES
THEY WILL BY VIOLENCE TEAR HIM FROM YOUR PALACE
AND TORTURE HIM WITH GRIEVOUS LINGERING DEATH 
THEY SAY BY HIM THE GOOD DUKE HUMPHREY DIED
THEY SAY IN HIM THEY FEAR YOUR HIGHNESS DEATH
AND MERE INSTINCT OF LOVE AND LOYALTY
FREE FROM A STUBBORN OPPOSITE INTENT
AS BEING THOUGHT TO CONTRADICT YOUR LIKING
MAKES THEM THUS FORWARD IN HIS BANISHMENT 
THEY SAY IN CARE OF YOUR MOST ROYAL PERSON
THAT IF YOUR HIGHNESS SHOULD INTEND TO SLEEP
AND CHARGE THAT NO MAN SHOULD DISTURB YOUR REST
IN PAIN OF YOUR DISLIKE OR PAIN OF DEATH
YET NOTWITHSTANDING SUCH A STRAIT EDICT
WERE THERE A SERPENT SEEN WITH FORKED TONGUE
THAT SLILY GLIDED TOWARDS YOUR MAJESTY
IT WERE BUT NECESSARY YOU WERE WAKED
LEST BEING SUFFERD IN THAT HARMFUL SLUMBER
THE MORTAL WORM MIGHT MAKE THE SLEEP ETERNAL
AND THEREFORE DO THEY CRY THOUGH YOU FORBID
THAT THEY WILL GUARD YOU WHETHER YOU WILL OR NO
FROM SUCH FELL SERPENTS AS FALSE SUFFOLK IS
WITH WHOSE ENVENOMED AND FATAL STING
YOUR LOVING UNCLE TWENTY TIMES HIS WORTH
THEY SAY IS SHAMEFULLY BEREFT OF LIFE 
  AN ANSWER FROM THE KING MY
LORD OF SALISBURY 
TIS LIKE THE COMMONS RUDE UNPOLISHD HINDS
COULD SEND SUCH MESSAGE TO THEIR SOVEREIGN
BUT YOU MY LORD WERE GLAD TO BE EMPLOYD
TO SHOW HOW QUAINT AN ORATOR YOU ARE
BUT ALL THE HONOUR SALISBURY HATH WON
IS THAT HE WAS THE LORD AMBASSADOR
SENT FROM A SORT OF TINKERS TO THE KING 
  AN ANSWER FROM THE KING OR WE WILL ALL BREAK IN 
GO SALISBURY AND TELL THEM ALL FROM ME 
I THANK THEM FOR THEIR TENDER LOVING CARE
AND HAD I NOT BEEN CITED SO BY THEM
YET DID I PURPOSE AS THEY DO ENTREAT
FOR SURE MY THOUGHTS DO HOURLY PROPHESY
MISCHANCE UNTO MY STATE BY SUFFOLKS MEANS
AND THEREFORE BY HIS MAJESTY I SWEAR
WHOSE FAR UNWORTHY DEPUTY I AM
HE SHALL NOT BREATHE INFECTION IN THIS AIR
BUT THREE DAYS LONGER ON THE PAIN OF DEATH 
O HENRY LET ME PLEAD FOR GENTLE SUFFOLK 
UNGENTLE QUEEN TO CALL HIM GENTLE SUFFOLK 
NO MORE I SAY IF THOU DOST PLEAD FOR HIM
THOU WILT BUT ADD INCREASE UNTO MY WRATH 
HAD I BUT SAID I WOULD HAVE KEPT MY WORD
BUT WHEN I SWEAR IT IS IRREVOCABLE 
IF AFTER THREE DAYS SPACE THOU HERE BEST FOUND
ON ANY GROUND THAT I AM RULER OF
THE WORLD SHALL NOT BE RANSOM FOR THY LIFE 
COME WARWICK COME GOOD WARWICK GO WITH ME
I HAVE GREAT MATTERS TO IMPART TO THEE 
MISCHANCE AND SORROW GO ALONG WITH YOU 
HEARTS DISCONTENT AND SOUR AFFLICTION
BE PLAYFELLOWS TO KEEP YOU COMPANY 
THERES TWO OF YOU THE DEVIL MAKE A THIRD 
AND THREEFOLD VENGEANCE TEND UPON YOUR STEPS 
CEASE GENTLE QUEEN THESE EXECRATIONS
AND LET THY SUFFOLK TAKE HIS HEAVY LEAVE 
FIE COWARD WOMAN AND SOFTHEARTED WRETCH 
HAST THOU NOT SPIRIT TO CURSE THINE ENEMY
A PLAGUE UPON THEM  WHEREFORE SHOULD I CURSE THEM
WOULD CURSES KILL AS DOTH THE MANDRAKES GROAN
I WOULD INVENT AS BITTERSEARCHING TERMS
AS CURST AS HARSH AND HORRIBLE TO HEAR
DELIVERD STRONGLY THROUGH MY FIXED TEETH
WITH FULL AS MANY SIGNS OF DEADLY HATE
AS LEANFACED ENVY IN HER LOATHSOME CAVE
MY TONGUE SHOULD STUMBLE IN MINE EARNEST WORDS
MINE EYES SHOULD SPARKLE LIKE THE BEATEN FLINT
MINE HAIR BE FIXED ON END AS ONE DISTRACT
AY EVERY JOINT SHOULD SEEM TO CURSE AND BAN
AND EVEN NOW MY BURTHEND HEART WOULD BREAK
SHOULD I NOT CURSE THEM  POISON BE THEIR DRINK 
GALL WORSE THAN GALL THE DAINTIEST THAT THEY TASTE 
THEIR SWEETEST SHADE A GROVE OF CYPRESS TREES 
THEIR CHIEFEST PROSPECT MURDERING BASILISKS 
THEIR SOFTEST TOUCH AS SMART AS LIZARDS STING 
THEIR MUSIC FRIGHTFUL AS THE SERPENTS HISS
AND BODING SCREECHOWLS MAKE THE CONCERT FULL 
ALL THE FOUL TERRORS IN DARKSEATED HELL 
ENOUGH SWEET SUFFOLK THOU TORMENTST THYSELF
AND THESE DREAD CURSES LIKE THE SUN GAINST GLASS
OR LIKE AN OVERCHARGED GUN RECOIL
AND TURN THE FORCE OF THEM UPON THYSELF 
YOU BADE ME BAN AND WILL YOU BID ME LEAVE
NOW BY THE GROUND THAT I AM BANISHD FROM
WELL COULD I CURSE AWAY A WINTERS NIGHT
THOUGH STANDING NAKED ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
WHERE BITING COLD WOULD NEVER LET GRASS GROW
AND THINK IT BUT A MINUTE SPENT IN SPORT 
O LET ME ENTREAT THEE CEASE  GIVE ME THY HAND
THAT I MAY DEW IT WITH MY MOURNFUL TEARS
NOR LET THE RAIN OF HEAVEN WET THIS PLACE
TO WASH AWAY MY WOFUL MONUMENTS
