AND A PETITION GRANTED THEM A STRANGE ONE 
TO BREAK THE HEART OF GENEROSITY
AND MAKE BOLD POWER LOOK PALE THEY THREW THEIR CAPS
AS THEY WOULD HANG THEM ON THE HORNS O THE MOON
SHOUTING THEIR EMULATION

BEING MOVED HE WILL NOT SPARE TO GIRD THE GODS 
BEMOCK THE MODEST MOON 
THE PRESENT WARS DEVOUR HIM HE IS GROWN
TOO PROUD TO BE SO VALIANT 
SUCH A NATURE
TICKLED WITH GOOD SUCCESS DISDAINS THE SHADOW
WHICH HE TREADS ON AT NOON BUT I DO WONDER
HIS INSOLENCE CAN BROOK TO BE COMMANDED
UNDER COMINIUS 
FAME AT THE WHICH HE AIMS
IN WHOM ALREADY HES WELL GRACED CAN NOT

IN AUGHT HE MERIT NOT 
LETS HENCE AND HEAR
HOW THE DISPATCH IS MADE AND IN WHAT FASHION

COMINIUS MARCIUS YOUR OLD ENEMY
WHO IS OF ROME WORSE HATED THAN OF YOU
AND TITUS LARTIUS A MOST VALIANT ROMAN
THESE THREE LEAD ON THIS PREPARATION
WHITHER TIS BENT MOST LIKELY TIS FOR YOU
CONSIDER OF IT 
OUR ARMYS IN THE FIELD
WE NEVER YET MADE DOUBT BUT ROME WAS READY
TO ANSWER US 
NOR DID YOU THINK IT FOLLY
TO KEEP YOUR GREAT PRETENCES VEILD TILL WHEN
THEY NEEDS MUST SHOW THEMSELVES WHICH
IN THE HATCHING

EVER RIGHT 
MENENIUS EVER EVER 
GIVE WAY THERE AND GO ON 
  YOUR HAND AND YOURS
ERE IN OUR OWN HOUSE I DO SHADE MY HEAD
THE GOOD PATRICIANS MUST BE VISITED
FROM WHOM I HAVE RECEIVED NOT ONLY GREETINGS
BUT WITH THEM CHANGE OF HONOURS 
I HAVE LIVED
TO SEE INHERITED MY VERY WISHES
AND THE BUILDINGS OF MY FANCY ONLY
THERES ONE THING WANTING WHICH I DOUBT NOT BUT
OUR ROME WILL CAST UPON THEE 
KNOW GOOD MOTHER
I HAD RATHER BE THEIR SERVANT IN MY WAY
THAN SWAY WITH THEM IN THEIRS 
ON TO THE CAPITOL 
ALL TONGUES SPEAK OF HIM AND THE BLEARED SIGHTS
ARE SPECTACLED TO SEE HIM YOUR PRATTLING NURSE
INTO A RAPTURE LETS HER BABY CRY
WHILE SHE CHATS HIM THE KITCHEN MALKIN PINS
HER RICHEST LOCKRAM BOUT HER REECHY NECK
CLAMBERING THE WALLS TO EYE HIM STALLS BULKS WINDOWS
ARE SMOTHERD UP LEADS FILLD AND RIDGES HORSED
WITH VARIABLE COMPLEXIONS ALL AGREEING
IN EARNESTNESS TO SEE HIM SELDSHOWN FLAMENS
DO PRESS AMONG THE POPULAR THRONGS AND PUFF
TO WIN A VULGAR STATION OR VEILD DAMES
COMMIT THE WAR OF WHITE AND DAMASK IN
THEIR NICELYGAWDED CHEEKS TO THE WANTON SPOIL
OF PHOEBUS BURNING KISSES SUCH A POTHER
AS IF THAT WHATSOEVER GOD WHO LEADS HIM
WERE SLILY CREPT INTO HIS HUMAN POWERS
AND GAVE HIM GRACEFUL POSTURE 
ON THE SUDDEN
I WARRANT HIM CONSUL 
THEN OUR OFFICE MAY
DURING HIS POWER GO SLEEP 
HE CANNOT TEMPERATELY TRANSPORT HIS HONOURS
FROM WHERE HE SHOULD BEGIN AND END BUT WILL
LOSE THOSE HE HATH WON 
IN THAT THERES COMFORT 
DOUBT NOT
THE COMMONERS FOR WHOM WE STAND BUT THEY
UPON THEIR ANCIENT MALICE WILL FORGET
WITH THE LEAST CAUSE THESE HIS NEW HONOURS WHICH
THAT HE WILL GIVE THEM MAKE I AS LITTLE QUESTION
AS HE IS PROUD TO DOT 
I HEARD HIM SWEAR
WERE HE TO STAND FOR CONSUL NEVER WOULD HE
APPEAR I THE MARKETPLACE NOR ON HIM PUT
THE NAPLESS VESTURE OF HUMILITY
NOR SHOWING AS THE MANNER IS HIS WOUNDS
TO THE PEOPLE BEG THEIR STINKING BREATHS 
TIS RIGHT 
IT WAS HIS WORD O HE WOULD MISS IT RATHER
THAN CARRY IT BUT BY THE SUIT OF THE GENTRY TO HIM
AND THE DESIRE OF THE NOBLES 
I WISH NO BETTER
THAN HAVE HIM HOLD THAT PURPOSE AND TO PUT IT
IN EXECUTION 
TIS MOST LIKE HE WILL 
IT SHALL BE TO HIM THEN AS OUR GOOD WILLS
A SURE DESTRUCTION 
SO IT MUST FALL OUT
TO HIM OR OUR AUTHORITIES  FOR AN END
WE MUST SUGGEST THE PEOPLE IN WHAT HATRED
HE STILL HATH HELD THEM THAT TOS POWER HE WOULD
HAVE MADE THEM MULES SILENCED THEIR PLEADERS AND
DISPROPERTIED THEIR FREEDOMS HOLDING THEM
IN HUMAN ACTION AND CAPACITY
OF NO MORE SOUL NOR FITNESS FOR THE WORLD
THAN CAMELS IN THE WAR WHO HAVE THEIR PROVAND
ONLY FOR BEARING BURDENS AND SORE BLOWS
FOR SINKING UNDER THEM 
THIS AS YOU SAY SUGGESTED
AT SOME TIME WHEN HIS SOARING INSOLENCE
SHALL TOUCH THE PEOPLE WHICH TIME SHALL NOT WANT
IF HE BE PUT UPON T AND THATS AS EASY
AS TO SET DOGS ON SHEEP WILL BE HIS FIRE
TO KINDLE THEIR DRY STUBBLE AND THEIR BLAZE
SHALL DARKEN HIM FOR EVER 
WHATS THE MATTER
YOU ARE SENT FOR TO THE CAPITOL  TIS THOUGHT
THAT MARCIUS SHALL BE CONSUL
I HAVE SEEN THE DUMB MEN THRONG TO SEE HIM AND
THE BLIND TO BEAR HIM SPEAK MATRONS FLUNG GLOVES
LADIES AND MAIDS THEIR SCARFS AND HANDKERCHERS
UPON HIM AS HE PASSD THE NOBLES BENDED
AS TO JOVES STATUE AND THE COMMONS MADE
A SHOWER AND THUNDER WITH THEIR CAPS AND SHOUTS
I NEVER SAW THE LIKE 
LETS TO THE CAPITOL
AND CARRY WITH US EARS AND EYES FOR THE TIME
BUT HEARTS FOR THE EVENT 
HAVE WITH YOU 
COME COME THEY ARE ALMOST HERE  HOW MANY STAND
FOR CONSULSHIPS
THREE THEY SAY BUT TIS THOUGHT OF EVERY ONE
CORIOLANUS WILL CARRY IT 
THATS A BRAVE FELLOW BUT HES VENGEANCE PROUD AND
LOVES NOT THE COMMON PEOPLE 
FAITH THERE HAD BEEN MANY GREAT MEN THAT HAVE
FLATTERED THE PEOPLE WHO NEER LOVED THEM AND THERE
BE MANY THAT THEY HAVE LOVED THEY KNOW NOT
WHEREFORE SO THAT IF THEY LOVE THEY KNOW NOT WHY
THEY HATE UPON NO BETTER A GROUND THEREFORE FOR
CORIOLANUS NEITHER TO CARE WHETHER THEY LOVE OR HATE
HIM MANIFESTS THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE HE HAS IN THEIR
DISPOSITION AND OUT OF HIS NOBLE CARELESSNESS LETS
THEM PLAINLY SEET 
IF HE DID NOT CARE WHETHER HE HAD THEIR LOVE OR NO
HE WAVED INDIFFERENTLY TWIXT DOING THEM NEITHER
GOOD NOR HARM BUT HE SEEKS THEIR HATE WITH GREATER
DEVOTION THAN CAN RENDER IT HIM AND LEAVES
NOTHING UNDONE THAT MAY FULLY DISCOVER HIM THEIR
OPPOSITE  NOW TO SEEM TO AFFECT THE MALICE AND
DISPLEASURE OF THE PEOPLE IS AS BAD AS THAT WHICH HE
DISLIKES TO FLATTER THEM FOR THEIR LOVE 
HE HATH DESERVED WORTHILY OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS
ASCENT IS NOT BY SUCH EASY DEGREES AS THOSE WHO
HAVING BEEN SUPPLE AND COURTEOUS TO THE PEOPLE
BONNETED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DEED TO HAVE THEM AT
AN INTO THEIR ESTIMATION AND REPORT BUT HE HATH SO
PLANTED HIS HONOURS IN THEIR EYES AND HIS ACTIONS
IN THEIR HEARTS THAT FOR THEIR TONGUES TO BE
SILENT AND NOT CONFESS SO MUCH WERE A KIND OF
INGRATEFUL INJURY TO REPORT OTHERWISE WERE A
MALICE THAT GIVING ITSELF THE LIE WOULD PLUCK
REPROOF AND REBUKE FROM EVERY EAR THAT HEARD IT 
NO MORE OF HIM HE IS A WORTHY MAN MAKE WAY THEY
ARE COMING 
HAVING DETERMINED OF THE VOLSCES AND
TO SEND FOR TITUS LARTIUS IT REMAINS
AS THE MAIN POINT OF THIS OUR AFTERMEETING
TO GRATIFY HIS NOBLE SERVICE THAT
HATH THUS STOOD FOR HIS COUNTRY THEREFORE
PLEASE YOU
MOST REVEREND AND GRAVE ELDERS TO DESIRE
THE PRESENT CONSUL AND LAST GENERAL

AND STRUCK HIM ON HIS KNEE IN THAT DAYS FEATS
WHEN HE MIGHT ACT THE WOMAN IN THE SCENE
HE PROVED BEST MAN I THE FIELD AND FOR HIS MEED
WAS BROWBOUND WITH THE OAK  HIS PUPIL AGE
MANENTERD THUS HE WAXED LIKE A SEA
AND IN THE BRUNT OF SEVENTEEN BATTLES SINCE
HE LURCHD ALL SWORDS OF THE GARLAND  FOR THIS LAST
BEFORE AND IN CORIOLI LET ME SAY
I CANNOT SPEAK HIM HOME HE STOPPD THE FLIERS
AND BY HIS RARE EXAMPLE MADE THE COWARD
TURN TERROR INTO SPORT AS WEEDS BEFORE
A VESSEL UNDER SAIL SO MEN OBEYD
AND FELL BELOW HIS STEM HIS SWORD DEATHS STAMP
WHERE IT DID MARK IT TOOK FROM FACE TO FOOT
HE WAS A THING OF BLOOD WHOSE EVERY MOTION
WAS TIMED WITH DYING CRIES ALONE HE ENTERD
THE MORTAL GATE OF THE CITY WHICH HE PAINTED
WITH SHUNLESS DESTINY AIDLESS CAME OFF
AND WITH A SUDDEN REINFORCEMENT STRUCK
CORIOLI LIKE A PLANET NOW ALLS HIS
WHEN BY AND BY THE DIN OF WAR GAN PIERCE
HIS READY SENSE THEN STRAIGHT HIS DOUBLED SPIRIT
REQUICKEND WHAT IN FLESH WAS FATIGATE
AND TO THE BATTLE CAME HE WHERE HE DID
RUN REEKING OER THE LIVES OF MEN AS IF
TWERE A PERPETUAL SPOIL AND TILL WE CALLD
BOTH FIELD AND CITY OURS HE NEVER STOOD
TO EASE HIS BREAST WITH PANTING 
WORTHY MAN 
HE CANNOT BUT WITH MEASURE FIT THE HONOURS
WHICH WE DEVISE HIM 
OUR SPOILS HE KICKD AT
AND LOOKD UPON THINGS PRECIOUS AS THEY WERE
THE COMMON MUCK OF THE WORLD HE COVETS LESS
THAN MISERY ITSELF WOULD GIVE REWARDS
HIS DEEDS WITH DOING THEM AND IS CONTENT
TO SPEND THE TIME TO END IT 
HES RIGHT NOBLE
LET HIM BE CALLD FOR 
CALL CORIOLANUS 
HE DOTH APPEAR

TO MAKE THEE CONSUL 
I DO OWE THEM STILL
MY LIFE AND SERVICES 
IT THEN REMAINS

PUT ON THE GOWN STAND NAKED AND ENTREAT THEM
FOR MY WOUNDS SAKE TO GIVE THEIR SUFFRAGE PLEASE YOU
THAT I MAY PASS THIS DOING 
SIR THE PEOPLE
MUST HAVE THEIR VOICES NEITHER WILL THEY BATE
ONE JOT OF CEREMONY 
PUT THEM NOT TOT
PRAY YOU GO FIT YOU TO THE CUSTOM AND
TAKE TO YOU AS YOUR PREDECESSORS HAVE
YOUR HONOUR WITH YOUR FORM 
IT IS APART
THAT I SHALL BLUSH IN ACTING AND MIGHT WELL
BE TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE

POWER THAT WE HAVE NO POWER TO DO FOR IF HE SHOW US

TONGUES INTO THOSE WOUNDS AND SPEAK FOR THEM SO IF
HE TELL US HIS NOBLE DEEDS WE MUST ALSO TELL HIM
OUR NOBLE ACCEPTANCE OF THEM  INGRATITUDE IS
MONSTROUS AND FOR THE MULTITUDE TO BE INGRATEFUL
WERE TO MAKE A MONSTER OF THE MULTITUDE OF THE
WHICH WE BEING MEMBERS SHOULD BRING OURSELVES TO BE
MONSTROUS MEMBERS 
AND TO MAKE US NO BETTER THOUGHT OF A LITTLE HELP
WILL SERVE FOR ONCE WE STOOD UP ABOUT THE CORN HE
HIMSELF STUCK NOT TO CALL US THE MANYHEADED MULTITUDE 
WE HAVE BEEN CALLED SO OF MANY NOT THAT OUR HEADS
ARE SOME BROWN SOME BLACK SOME AUBURN SOME BALD
BUT THAT OUR WITS ARE SO DIVERSELY COLOURED AND
TRULY I THINK IF ALL OUR WITS WERE TO ISSUE OUT OF
ONE SKULL THEY WOULD FLY EAST WEST NORTH SOUTH
AND THEIR CONSENT OF ONE DIRECT WAY SHOULD BE AT
ONCE TO ALL THE POINTS O THE COMPASS 
THINK YOU SO WHICH WAY DO YOU JUDGE MY WIT WOULD
FLY

MELTED AWAY WITH ROTTEN DEWS THE FOURTH WOULD RETURN
FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE TO HELP TO GET THEE A WIFE 
YOU ARE NEVER WITHOUT YOUR TRICKS YOU MAY YOU MAY 
ARE YOU ALL RESOLVED TO GIVE YOUR VOICES BUT

SAY IF HE WOULD INCLINE TO THE PEOPLE THERE WAS
NEVER A WORTHIER MAN

BEHAVIOR  WE ARE NOT TO STAY ALL TOGETHER BUT TO
COME BY HIM WHERE HE STANDS BY ONES BY TWOS AND
BY THREES  HES TO MAKE HIS REQUESTS BY
PARTICULARS WHEREIN EVERY ONE OF US HAS A SINGLE
HONOUR IN GIVING HIM OUR OWN VOICES WITH OUR OWN
TONGUES THEREFORE FOLLOW ME AND I DIRECT YOU HOW
YOU SHALL GO BY HIM

BASTARD CHILDREN THAN WARS A DESTROYER OF MEN 
TIS SO AND AS WAR IN SOME SORT MAY BE SAID TO
BE A RAVISHER SO IT CANNOT BE DENIED BUT PEACE IS A
GREAT MAKER OF CUCKOLDS 
AY AND IT MAKES MEN HATE ONE ANOTHER 
REASON BECAUSE THEY THEN LESS NEED ONE ANOTHER

HAD LOVED YOU AS WE DID 
NOW THE GODS KEEP YOU 
FAREWELL FAREWELL 
THIS IS A HAPPIER AND MORE COMELY TIME
THAN WHEN THESE FELLOWS RAN ABOUT THE STREETS
CRYING CONFUSION 
CAIUS MARCIUS WAS
A WORTHY OFFICER I THE WAR BUT INSOLENT
OERCOME WITH PRIDE AMBITIOUS PAST ALL THINKING
SELFLOVING 
AND AFFECTING ONE SOLE THRONE
WITHOUT ASSISTANCE 
I THINK NOT SO 
WE SHOULD BY THIS TO ALL OUR LAMENTATION
IF HE HAD GONE FORTH CONSUL FOUND IT SO 
THE GODS HAVE WELL PREVENTED IT AND ROME
SITS SAFE AND STILL WITHOUT HIM 
WORTHY TRIBUNES
THERE IS A SLAVE WHOM WE HAVE PUT IN PRISON
REPORTS THE VOLSCES WITH TWO SEVERAL POWERS
ARE ENTERD IN THE ROMAN TERRITORIES
AND WITH THE DEEPEST MALICE OF THE WAR
DESTROY WHAT LIES BEFORE EM 
TIS AUFIDIUS
WHO HEARING OF OUR MARCIUS BANISHMENT
THRUSTS FORTH HIS HORNS AGAIN INTO THE WORLD
WHICH WERE INSHELLD WHEN MARCIUS STOOD FOR ROME
AND DURST NOT ONCE PEEP OUT 
COME WHAT TALK YOU
OF MARCIUS
GO SEE THIS RUMOURER WHIPPD  IT CANNOT BE
THE VOLSCES DARE BREAK WITH US 
CANNOT BE 
WE HAVE RECORD THAT VERY WELL IT CAN
AND THREE EXAMPLES OF THE LIKE HAVE BEEN
WITHIN MY AGE  BUT REASON WITH THE FELLOW

HOW PROBABLE I DO NOT KNOW THAT MARCIUS
JOIND WITH AUFIDIUS LEADS A POWER GAINST ROME
AND VOWS REVENGE AS SPACIOUS AS BETWEEN
THE YOUNGST AND OLDEST THING 
THIS IS MOST LIKELY 
RAISED ONLY THAT THE WEAKER SORT MAY WISH
GOOD MARCIUS HOME AGAIN 
THE VERY TRICK ONT 
THIS IS UNLIKELY
HE AND AUFIDIUS CAN NO MORE ATONE
THAN VIOLENTEST CONTRARIETY 
YOU ARE SENT FOR TO THE SENATE
A FEARFUL ARMY LED BY CAIUS MARCIUS
ASSOCIATED WITH AUFIDIUS RAGES
UPON OUR TERRITORIES AND HAVE ALREADY
OERBORNE THEIR WAY CONSUMED WITH FIRE AND TOOK
WHAT LAY BEFORE THEM 
O YOU HAVE MADE GOOD WORK 
WHAT NEWS WHAT NEWS
YOU HAVE HOLP TO RAVISH YOUR OWN DAUGHTERS AND
TO MELT THE CITY LEADS UPON YOUR PATES
TO SEE YOUR WIVES DISHONOURD TO YOUR NOSES 
WHATS THE NEWS WHATS THE NEWS
YOUR TEMPLES BURNED IN THEIR CEMENT AND
YOUR FRANCHISES WHEREON YOU STOOD CONFINED
INTO AN AUGERS BORE 
PRAY NOW YOUR NEWS
YOU HAVE MADE FAIR WORK I FEAR ME  PRAY YOUR NEWS 
IF MARCIUS SHOULD BE JOIND WITH VOLSCIANS 
IF 
HE IS THEIR GOD HE LEADS THEM LIKE A THING
MADE BY SOME OTHER DEITY THAN NATURE
THAT SHAPES MAN BETTER AND THEY FOLLOW HIM
AGAINST US BRATS WITH NO LESS CONFIDENCE
THAN BOYS PURSUING SUMMER BUTTERFLIES
OR BUTCHERS KILLING FLIES 
YOU HAVE MADE GOOD WORK
YOU AND YOUR APRONMEN YOU THAT STOOD SO UP MUCH
ON THE VOICE OF OCCUPATION AND
THE BREATH OF GARLICEATERS 
HE WILL SHAKE
YOUR ROME ABOUT YOUR EARS 
AS HERCULES
DID SHAKE DOWN MELLOW FRUIT 
YOU HAVE MADE FAIR WORK 
BUT IS THIS TRUE SIR
AY AND YOULL LOOK PALE

WE ARE ALL UNDONE UNLESS
THE NOBLE MAN HAVE MERCY 
WHO SHALL ASK IT
THE TRIBUNES CANNOT DOT FOR SHAME THE PEOPLE
DESERVE SUCH PITY OF HIM AS THE WOLF
DOES OF THE SHEPHERDS FOR HIS BEST FRIENDS IF THEY
SHOULD SAY BE GOOD TO ROME THEY CHARGED HIM EVEN
AS THOSE SHOULD DO THAT HAD DESERVED HIS HATE
AND THEREIN SHOWD LIKE ENEMIES 
TIS TRUE
IF HE WERE PUTTING TO MY HOUSE THE BRAND
THAT SHOULD CONSUME IT I HAVE NOT THE FACE
TO SAY BESEECH YOU CEASE  YOU HAVE MADE FAIR HANDS
YOU AND YOUR CRAFTS  YOU HAVE CRAFTED FAIR 
YOU HAVE BROUGHT
A TREMBLING UPON ROME SUCH AS WAS NEVER
SO INCAPABLE OF HELP 
SAY NOT WE BROUGHT IT 
HOW  WAS IT WE WE LOVED HIM BUT LIKE BEASTS
AND COWARDLY NOBLES GAVE WAY UNTO YOUR CLUSTERS
WHO DID HOOT HIM OUT O THE CITY 
BUT I FEAR
THEYLL ROAR HIM IN AGAIN  TULLUS AUFIDIUS
THE SECOND NAME OF MEN OBEYS HIS POINTS
AS IF HE WERE HIS OFFICER DESPERATION
IS ALL THE POLICY STRENGTH AND DEFENCE
THAT ROME CAN MAKE AGAINST THEM 
HERE COME THE CLUSTERS 
AND IS AUFIDIUS WITH HIM YOU ARE THEY
THAT MADE THE AIR UNWHOLESOME WHEN YOU CAST
YOUR STINKING GREASY CAPS IN HOOTING AT
CORIOLANUS EXILE  NOW HES COMING
AND NOT A HAIR UPON A SOLDIERS HEAD
WHICH WILL NOT PROVE A WHIP AS MANY COXCOMBS
AS YOU THREW CAPS UP WILL HE TUMBLE DOWN
AND PAY YOU FOR YOUR VOICES  TIS NO MATTER
IF HE COULD BURN US ALL INTO ONE COAL
WE HAVE DESERVED IT 
FAITH WE HEAR FEARFUL NEWS 
FOR MINE OWN PART
WHEN I SAID BANISH HIM I SAID TWAS PITY 
AND SO DID I 
AND SO DID I AND TO SAY THE TRUTH SO DID VERY
MANY OF US THAT WE DID WE DID FOR THE BEST AND
THOUGH WE WILLINGLY CONSENTED TO HIS BANISHMENT YET
IT WAS AGAINST OUR WILL 
YE RE GOODLY THINGS YOU VOICES 
YOU HAVE MADE
GOOD WORK YOU AND YOUR CRY  SHALLS TO THE CAPITOL
O AY WHAT ELSE
GO MASTERS GET YOU HOME BE NOT DISMAYD
THESE ARE A SIDE THAT WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE
THIS TRUE WHICH THEY SO SEEM TO FEAR  GO HOME
AND SHOW NO SIGN OF FEAR 
THE GODS BE GOOD TO US  COME MASTERS LETS HOME 
I EVER SAID WE WERE I THE WRONG WHEN WE BANISHED
HIM 
SO DID WE ALL  BUT COME LETS HOME 
I DO NOT LIKE THIS NEWS 
NOR I 
LETS TO THE CAPITOL  WOULD HALF MY WEALTH
WOULD BUY THIS FOR A LIE 
PRAY LET US GO 
DO THEY STILL FLY TO THE ROMAN
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WITCHCRAFTS IN HIM BUT
YOUR SOLDIERS USE HIM AS THE GRACE FORE MEAT
THEIR TALK AT TABLE AND THEIR THANKS AT END
AND YOU ARE DARKEND IN THIS ACTION SIR
EVEN BY YOUR OWN 
I CANNOT HELP IT NOW
UNLESS BY USING MEANS I LAME THE FOOT
OF OUR DESIGN  HE BEARS HIMSELF MORE PROUDLIER
EVEN TO MY PERSON THAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD
WHEN FIRST I DID EMBRACE HIM YET HIS NATURE
IN THATS NO CHANGELING AND I MUST EXCUSE
WHAT CANNOT BE AMENDED 
YET I WISH SIR 
I MEAN FOR YOUR PARTICULAR YOU HAD NOT
JOIND IN COMMISSION WITH HIM BUT EITHER
HAD BORNE THE ACTION OF YOURSELF OR ELSE
TO HIM HAD LEFT IT SOLELY 
I UNDERSTAND THEE WELL AND BE THOU SURE
WHEN HE SHALL COME TO HIS ACCOUNT HE KNOWS NOT
WHAT I CAN URGE AGAINST HIM  ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS
AND SO HE THINKS AND IS NO LESS APPARENT
TO THE VULGAR EYE THAT HE BEARS ALL THINGS FAIRLY 
AND SHOWS GOOD HUSBANDRY FOR THE VOLSCIAN STATE
FIGHTS DRAGONLIKE AND DOES ACHIEVE AS SOON
AS DRAW HIS SWORD YET HE HATH LEFT UNDONE
THAT WHICH SHALL BREAK HIS NECK OR HAZARD MINE
WHENEER WE COME TO OUR ACCOUNT 
SIR I BESEECH YOU THINK YOU HELL CARRY ROME
ALL PLACES YIELD TO HIM ERE HE SITS DOWN
AND THE NOBILITY OF ROME ARE HIS
THE SENATORS AND PATRICIANS LOVE HIM TOO
THE TRIBUNES ARE NO SOLDIERS AND THEIR PEOPLE
WILL BE AS RASH IN THE REPEAL AS HASTY
TO EXPEL HIM THENCE  I THINK HELL BE TO ROME
AS IS THE OSPREY TO THE FISH WHO TAKES IT
BY SOVEREIGNTY OF NATURE  FIRST HE WAS
A NOBLE SERVANT TO THEM BUT HE COULD NOT
CARRY HIS HONOURS EVEN WHETHER TWAS PRIDE
WHICH OUT OF DAILY FORTUNE EVER TAINTS
THE HAPPY MAN WHETHER DEFECT OF JUDGMENT
TO FAIL IN THE DISPOSING OF THOSE CHANCES
WHICH HE WAS LORD OF OR WHETHER NATURE
NOT TO BE OTHER THAN ONE THING NOT MOVING
FROM THE CASQUE TO THE CUSHION BUT COMMANDING PEACE
EVEN WITH THE SAME AUSTERITY AND GARB
AS HE CONTROLLD THE WAR BUT ONE OF THESE 
AS HE HATH SPICES OF THEM ALL NOT ALL
FOR I DARE SO FAR FREE HIM MADE HIM FEARD
SO HATED AND SO BANISHD BUT HE HAS A MERIT
TO CHOKE IT IN THE UTTERANCE  SO OUR VIRTUES
LIE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TIME
AND POWER UNTO ITSELF MOST COMMENDABLE
HATH NOT A TOMB SO EVIDENT AS A CHAIR
TO EXTOL WHAT IT HATH DONE 
ONE FIRE DRIVES OUT ONE FIRE ONE NAIL ONE NAIL
RIGHTS BY RIGHTS FALTER STRENGTHS BY STRENGTHS DO FAIL 
COME LETS AWAY  WHEN CAIUS ROME IS THINE
THOU ART POORST OF ALL THEN SHORTLY ART THOU MINE 
NO ILL NOT GO YOU HEAR WHAT HE HATH SAID
WHICH WAS SOMETIME HIS GENERAL WHO LOVED HIM
IN A MOST DEAR PARTICULAR  HE CALLD ME FATHER
BUT WHAT O THAT GO YOU THAT BANISHD HIM
A MILE BEFORE HIS TENT FALL DOWN AND KNEE
THE WAY INTO HIS MERCY NAY IF HE COYD
TO HEAR COMINIUS SPEAK ILL KEEP AT HOME 
HE WOULD NOT SEEM TO KNOW ME 
DO YOU HEAR
YET ONE TIME HE DID CALL ME BY MY NAME
I URGED OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND THE DROPS
THAT WE HAVE BLED TOGETHER  CORIOLANUS
HE WOULD NOT ANSWER TO FORBAD ALL NAMES
HE WAS A KIND OF NOTHING TITLELESS
TILL HE HAD FORGED HIMSELF A NAME O THE FIRE
OF BURNING ROME 
WHY SO YOU HAVE MADE GOOD WORK 
A PAIR OF TRIBUNES THAT HAVE RACKD FOR ROME
TO MAKE COALS CHEAP A NOBLE MEMORY 
I MINDED HIM HOW ROYAL TWAS TO PARDON
WHEN IT WAS LESS EXPECTED HE REPLIED
IT WAS A BARE PETITION OF A STATE
TO ONE WHOM THEY HAD PUNISHD 
VERY WELL
COULD HE SAY LESS
I OFFERD TO AWAKEN HIS REGARD
FORS PRIVATE FRIENDS HIS ANSWER TO ME WAS
HE COULD NOT STAY TO PICK THEM IN A PILE
OF NOISOME MUSTY CHAFF HE SAID TWAS FOLLY
FOR ONE POOR GRAIN OR TWO TO LEAVE UNBURNT
AND STILL TO NOSE THE OFFENCE 
FOR ONE POOR GRAIN OR TWO 
I AM ONE OF THOSE HIS MOTHER WIFE HIS CHILD
AND THIS BRAVE FELLOW TOO WE ARE THE GRAINS
YOU ARE THE MUSTY CHAFF AND YOU ARE SMELT
ABOVE THE MOON WE MUST BE BURNT FOR YOU 
NAY PRAY BE PATIENT IF YOU REFUSE YOUR AID
IN THIS SO NEVERNEEDED HELP YET DO NOT
UPBRAIDS WITH OUR DISTRESS  BUT SURE IF YOU
WOULD BE YOUR COUNTRYS PLEADER YOUR GOOD TONGUE
MORE THAN THE INSTANT ARMY WE CAN MAKE

WHAT SHOULD I DO
ONLY MAKE TRIAL WHAT YOUR LOVE CAN DO
FOR ROME TOWARDS MARCIUS 
WELL AND SAY THAT MARCIUS
RETURN ME AS COMINIUS IS RETURND
UNHEARD WHAT THEN
BUT AS A DISCONTENTED FRIEND GRIEFSHOT
WITH HIS UNKINDNESS SAYT BE SO

COULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS PEACE 
SEE YOU YOND COIGN O THE CAPITOL YOND
CORNERSTONE
WHY WHAT OF THAT
IF IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DISPLACE IT WITH YOUR
LITTLE FINGER THERE IS SOME HOPE THE LADIES OF
ROME ESPECIALLY HIS MOTHER MAY PREVAIL WITH HIM 
BUT I SAY THERE IS NO HOPE INT OUR THROATS ARE
SENTENCED AND STAY UPON EXECUTION 
IST POSSIBLE THAT SO SHORT A TIME CAN ALTER THE
CONDITION OF A MAN 
THERE IS DIFFERENCY BETWEEN A GRUB AND A BUTTERFLY
YET YOUR BUTTERFLY WAS A GRUB  THIS MARCIUS IS GROWN
FROM MAN TO DRAGON HE HAS WINGS HES MORE THAN A
CREEPING THING 
HE LOVED HIS MOTHER DEARLY 
SO DID HE ME AND HE NO MORE REMEMBERS HIS MOTHER
NOW THAN AN EIGHTYEAROLD HORSE  THE TARTNESS
OF HIS FACE SOURS RIPE GRAPES WHEN HE WALKS HE
MOVES LIKE AN ENGINE AND THE GROUND SHRINKS BEFORE
HIS TREADING HE IS ABLE TO PIERCE A CORSLET WITH
HIS EYE TALKS LIKE A KNELL AND HIS HUM IS A
BATTERY  HE SITS IN HIS STATE AS A THING MADE FOR
ALEXANDER  WHAT HE BIDS BE DONE IS FINISHED WITH
HIS BIDDING  HE WANTS NOTHING OF A GOD BUT ETERNITY
AND A HEAVEN TO THRONE IN 
YES MERCY IF YOU REPORT HIM TRULY 
I PAINT HIM IN THE CHARACTER  MARK WHAT MERCY HIS
MOTHER SHALL BRING FROM HIM THERE IS NO MORE MERCY
IN HIM THAN THERE IS MILK IN A MALE TIGER THAT
SHALL OUR POOR CITY FIND AND ALL THIS IS LONG OF
YOU 
THE GODS BE GOOD UNTO US 
NO IN SUCH A CASE THE GODS WILL NOT BE GOOD UNTO
US  WHEN WE BANISHED HIM WE RESPECTED NOT THEM
AND HE RETURNING TO BREAK OUR NECKS THEY RESPECT NOT US 
SIR IF YOULD SAVE YOUR LIFE FLY TO YOUR HOUSE
THE PLEBEIANS HAVE GOT YOUR FELLOWTRIBUNE
AND HALE HIM UP AND DOWN ALL SWEARING IF
THE ROMAN LADIES BRING NOT COMFORT HOME
THEYLL GIVE HIM DEATH BY INCHES 
WHATS THE NEWS

OF OUR GREAT ACTION THEREFORE SHALL HE DIE
