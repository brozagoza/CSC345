THEIR BATTERING CANNON CHARGED TO THE MOUTHS
TILL THEIR SOULFEARING CLAMOURS HAVE BRAWLD DOWN

SPEAK ON WITH FAVOUR WE ARE BENT TO HEAR 
THAT DAUGHTER THERE OF SPAIN THE LADY BLANCH
IS NIECE TO ENGLAND LOOK UPON THE YEARS
OF LEWIS THE DAUPHIN AND THAT LOVELY MAID
IF LUSTY LOVE SHOULD GO IN QUEST OF BEAUTY
WHERE SHOULD HE FIND IT FAIRER THAN IN BLANCH
IF ZEALOUS LOVE SHOULD GO IN SEARCH OF VIRTUE
WHERE SHOULD HE FIND IT PURER THAN IN BLANCH
IF LOVE AMBITIOUS SOUGHT A MATCH OF BIRTH
WHOSE VEINS BOUND RICHER BLOOD THAN LADY BLANCH

THE SEA ENRAGED IS NOT HALF SO DEAF
LIONS MORE CONFIDENT MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS
MORE FREE FROM MOTION NO NOT DEATH HIMSELF
IN MORAL FURY HALF SO PEREMPTORY
AS WE TO KEEP THIS CITY 
HERES A STAY
THAT SHAKES THE ROTTEN CARCASS OF OLD DEATH
OUT OF HIS RAGS  HERES A LARGE MOUTH INDEED
THAT SPITS FORTH DEATH AND MOUNTAINS ROCKS AND SEAS
TALKS AS FAMILIARLY OF ROARING LIONS
AS MAIDS OF THIRTEEN DO OF PUPPYDOGS 
WHAT CANNONEER BEGOT THIS LUSTY BLOOD
HE SPEAKS PLAIN CANNON FIRE AND SMOKE AND BOUNCE

RESEMBLING MAJESTY WHICH BEING TOUCHD AND TRIED

O THAT A MAN SHOULD SPEAK THOSE WORDS TO ME 
AND HANG A CALFSSKIN ON THOSE RECREANT LIMBS 
THOU DAREST NOT SAY SO VILLAIN FOR THY LIFE 
AND HANG A CALFSSKIN ON THOSE RECREANT LIMBS 
WE LIKE NOT THIS THOU DOST FORGET THYSELF 
HERE COMES THE HOLY LEGATE OF THE POPE 
HAIL YOU ANOINTED DEPUTIES OF HEAVEN 
TO THEE KING JOHN MY HOLY ERRAND IS 
I PANDULPH OF FAIR MILAN CARDINAL
AND FROM POPE INNOCENT THE LEGATE HERE
DO IN HIS NAME RELIGIOUSLY DEMAND
WHY THOU AGAINST THE CHURCH OUR HOLY MOTHER
SO WILFULLY DOST SPURN AND FORCE PERFORCE
KEEP STEPHEN LANGTON CHOSEN ARCHBISHOP
OF CANTERBURY FROM THAT HOLY SEE
THIS IN OUR FORESAID HOLY FATHERS NAME
POPE INNOCENT I DO DEMAND OF THEE 
WHAT EARTHY NAME TO INTERROGATORIES
CAN TASK THE FREE BREATH OF A SACRED KING
THOU CANST NOT CARDINAL DEVISE A NAME
SO SLIGHT UNWORTHY AND RIDICULOUS
TO CHARGE ME TO AN ANSWER AS THE POPE 
TELL HIM THIS TALE AND FROM THE MOUTH OF ENGLAND
ADD THUS MUCH MORE THAT NO ITALIAN PRIEST
SHALL TITHE OR TOLL IN OUR DOMINIONS
BUT AS WE UNDER HEAVEN ARE SUPREME HEAD
SO UNDER HIM THAT GREAT SUPREMACY
WHERE WE DO REIGN WE WILL ALONE UPHOLD
WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A MORTAL HAND
SO TELL THE POPE ALL REVERENCE SET APART
TO HIM AND HIS USURPD AUTHORITY 
BROTHER OF ENGLAND YOU BLASPHEME IN THIS 
THOUGH YOU AND ALL THE KINGS OF CHRISTENDOM
ARE LED SO GROSSLY BY THIS MEDDLING PRIEST
DREADING THE CURSE THAT MONEY MAY BUY OUT
AND BY THE MERIT OF VILE GOLD DROSS DUST
PURCHASE CORRUPTED PARDON OF A MAN
WHO IN THAT SALE SELLS PARDON FROM HIMSELF
THOUGH YOU AND ALL THE REST SO GROSSLY LED
THIS JUGGLING WITCHCRAFT WITH REVENUE CHERISH
YET I ALONE ALONE DO ME OPPOSE
AGAINST THE POPE AND COUNT HIS FRIENDS MY FOES 
THEN BY THE LAWFUL POWER THAT I HAVE
THOU SHALT STAND CURSED AND EXCOMMUNICATE 
AND BLESSED SHALL HE BE THAT DOTH REVOLT
FROM HIS ALLEGIANCE TO AN HERETIC
AND MERITORIOUS SHALL THAT HAND BE CALLD
CANONIZED AND WORSHIPPED AS A SAINT
THAT TAKES AWAY BY ANY SECRET COURSE
THY HATEFUL LIFE 
O LAWFUL LET IT BE
THAT I HAVE ROOM WITH ROME TO CURSE AWHILE 
GOOD FATHER CARDINAL CRY THOU AMEN
TO MY KEEN CURSES FOR WITHOUT MY WRONG
THERE IS NO TONGUE HATH POWER TO CURSE HIM RIGHT 
THERES LAW AND WARRANT LADY FOR MY CURSE 
AND FOR MINE TOO WHEN LAW CAN DO NO RIGHT
LET IT BE LAWFUL THAT LAW BAR NO WRONG
LAW CANNOT GIVE MY CHILD HIS KINGDOM HERE
FOR HE THAT HOLDS HIS KINGDOM HOLDS THE LAW
THEREFORE SINCE LAW ITSELF IS PERFECT WRONG
HOW CAN THE LAW FORBID MY TONGUE TO CURSE
PHILIP OF FRANCE ON PERIL OF A CURSE
LET GO THE HAND OF THAT ARCHHERETIC
AND RAISE THE POWER OF FRANCE UPON HIS HEAD
UNLESS HE DO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO ROME 
LOOKST THOU PALE FRANCE DO NOT LET GO THY HAND 
LOOK TO THAT DEVIL LEST THAT FRANCE REPENT
AND BY DISJOINING HANDS HELL LOSE A SOUL 
KING PHILIP LISTEN TO THE CARDINAL 
AND HANG A CALFSSKIN ON HIS RECREANT LIMBS 
WELL RUFFIAN I MUST POCKET UP THESE WRONGS BECAUSE 
YOUR BREECHES BEST MAY CARRY THEM 
PHILIP WHAT SAYST THOU TO THE CARDINAL
WHAT SHOULD HE SAY BUT AS THE CARDINAL
BETHINK YOU FATHER FOR THE DIFFERENCE
IS PURCHASE OF A HEAVY CURSE FROM ROME
OR THE LIGHT LOSS OF ENGLAND FOR A FRIEND
FOREGO THE EASIER 
THATS THE CURSE OF ROME 
O LEWIS STAND FAST  THE DEVIL TEMPTS THEE HERE
IN LIKENESS OF A NEW UNTRIMMED BRIDE 
THE LADY CONSTANCE SPEAKS NOT FROM HER FAITH
BUT FROM HER NEED 
O IF THOU GRANT MY NEED
WHICH ONLY LIVES BUT BY THE DEATH OF FAITH
THAT NEED MUST NEEDS INFER THIS PRINCIPLE
THAT FAITH WOULD LIVE AGAIN BY DEATH OF NEED 
O THEN TREAD DOWN MY NEED AND FAITH MOUNTS UP
KEEP MY NEED UP AND FAITH IS TRODDEN DOWN 
THE KING IS MOVED AND ANSWERS NOT TO THIS 
O BE REMOVED FROM HIM AND ANSWER WELL 
DO SO KING PHILIP HANG NO MORE IN DOUBT 
HANG NOTHING BUT A CALFSSKIN MOST SWEET LOUT 
I AM PERPLEXD AND KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY 
WHAT CANST THOU SAY BUT WILL PERPLEX THEE MORE
IF THOU STAND EXCOMMUNICATE AND CURSED
GOOD REVEREND FATHER MAKE MY PERSON YOURS
AND TELL ME HOW YOU WOULD BESTOW YOURSELF 
THIS ROYAL HAND AND MINE ARE NEWLY KNIT
AND THE CONJUNCTION OF OUR INWARD SOULS
MARRIED IN LEAGUE COUPLED AND LINKED TOGETHER
WITH ALL RELIGIOUS STRENGTH OF SACRED VOWS
THE LATEST BREATH THAT GAVE THE SOUND OF WORDS
WAS DEEPSWORN FAITH PEACE AMITY TRUE LOVE
BETWEEN OUR KINGDOMS AND OUR ROYAL SELVES
AND EVEN BEFORE THIS TRUCE BUT NEW BEFORE
NO LONGER THAN WE WELL COULD WASH OUR HANDS
TO CLAP THIS ROYAL BARGAIN UP OF PEACE
HEAVEN KNOWS THEY WERE BESMEARD AND OVERSTAIND
WITH SLAUGHTERS PENCIL WHERE REVENGE DID PAINT
THE FEARFUL DIFFERENCE OF INCENSED KINGS
AND SHALL THESE HANDS SO LATELY PURGED OF BLOOD
SO NEWLY JOIND IN LOVE SO STRONG IN BOTH
UNYOKE THIS SEIZURE AND THIS KIND REGREET
PLAY FAST AND LOOSE WITH FAITH SO JEST WITH HEAVEN
MAKE SUCH UNCONSTANT CHILDREN OF OURSELVES
AS NOW AGAIN TO SNATCH OUR PALM FROM PALM
UNSWEAR FAITH SWORN AND ON THE MARRIAGEBED
OF SMILING PEACE TO MARCH A BLOODY HOST
AND MAKE A RIOT ON THE GENTLE BROW
OF TRUE SINCERITY O HOLY SIR
MY REVEREND FATHER LET IT NOT BE SO 
OUT OF YOUR GRACE DEVISE ORDAIN IMPOSE
SOME GENTLE ORDER AND THEN WE SHALL BE BLEST
TO DO YOUR PLEASURE AND CONTINUE FRIENDS 
ALL FORM IS FORMLESS ORDER ORDERLESS
SAVE WHAT IS OPPOSITE TO ENGLANDS LOVE 
THEREFORE TO ARMS  BE CHAMPION OF OUR CHURCH
OR LET THE CHURCH OUR MOTHER BREATHE HER CURSE
A MOTHERS CURSE ON HER REVOLTING SON 
FRANCE THOU MAYST HOLD A SERPENT BY THE TONGUE
A CHAFED LION BY THE MORTAL PAW
A FASTING TIGER SAFER BY THE TOOTH
THAN KEEP IN PEACE THAT HAND WHICH THOU DOST HOLD 
I MAY DISJOIN MY HAND BUT NOT MY FAITH 
SO MAKEST THOU FAITH AN ENEMY TO FAITH
AND LIKE A CIVIL WAR SETST OATH TO OATH
THY TONGUE AGAINST THY TONGUE  O LET THY VOW
FIRST MADE TO HEAVEN FIRST BE TO HEAVEN PERFORMD
THAT IS TO BE THE CHAMPION OF OUR CHURCH 
WHAT SINCE THOU SWOREST IS SWORN AGAINST THYSELF
AND MAY NOT BE PERFORMED BY THYSELF
FOR THAT WHICH THOU HAST SWORN TO DO AMISS
IS NOT AMISS WHEN IT IS TRULY DONE
AND BEING NOT DONE WHERE DOING TENDS TO ILL
THE TRUTH IS THEN MOST DONE NOT DOING IT
THE BETTER ACT OF PURPOSES MISTOOK
IS TO MISTAKE AGAIN THOUGH INDIRECT
YET INDIRECTION THEREBY GROWS DIRECT
AND FALSEHOOD FALSEHOOD CURES AS FIRE COOLS FIRE
WITHIN THE SCORCHED VEINS OF ONE NEWBURND 
IT IS RELIGION THAT DOTH MAKE VOWS KEPT
BUT THOU HAST SWORN AGAINST RELIGION
BY WHAT THOU SWEARST AGAINST THE THING THOU SWEARST
AND MAKEST AN OATH THE SURETY FOR THY TRUTH
AGAINST AN OATH THE TRUTH THOU ART UNSURE
TO SWEAR SWEARS ONLY NOT TO BE FORSWORN
ELSE WHAT A MOCKERY SHOULD IT BE TO SWEAR 
BUT THOU DOST SWEAR ONLY TO BE FORSWORN
AND MOST FORSWORN TO KEEP WHAT THOU DOST SWEAR 
THEREFORE THY LATER VOWS AGAINST THY FIRST
IS IN THYSELF REBELLION TO THYSELF
AND BETTER CONQUEST NEVER CANST THOU MAKE
THAN ARM THY CONSTANT AND THY NOBLER PARTS
AGAINST THESE GIDDY LOOSE SUGGESTIONS
UPON WHICH BETTER PART OUR PRAYERS COME IN
IF THOU VOUCHSAFE THEM  BUT IF NOT THEN KNOW
THE PERIL OF OUR CURSES LIGHT ON THEE
SO HEAVY AS THOU SHALT NOT SHAKE THEM OFF
BUT IN DESPAIR DIE UNDER THEIR BLACK WEIGHT 
REBELLION FLAT REBELLION 
WILLT NOT BE
WILL NOT A CALFSSKIN STOP THAT MOUTH OF THINE
FATHER TO ARMS 
UPON THY WEDDINGDAY
AGAINST THE BLOOD THAT THOU HAST MARRIED
WHAT SHALL OUR FEAST BE KEPT WITH SLAUGHTERD MEN
SHALL BRAYING TRUMPETS AND LOUD CHURLISH DRUMS
CLAMOURS OF HELL BE MEASURES TO OUR POMP
O HUSBAND HEAR ME  AY ALACK HOW NEW

AND THOU POSSESSED WITH A THOUSAND WRONGS
OR IF THAT SURLY SPIRIT MELANCHOLY
HAD BAKED THY BLOOD AND MADE IT HEAVYTHICK

MAKING THAT IDIOT LAUGHTER KEEP MENS EYES
AND STRAIN THEIR CHEEKS TO IDLE MERRIMENT
A PASSION HATEFUL TO MY PURPOSES
OR IF THAT THOU COULDST SEE ME WITHOUT EYES
HEAR ME WITHOUT THINE EARS AND MAKE REPLY
WITHOUT A TONGUE USING CONCEIT ALONE
WITHOUT EYES EARS AND HARMFUL SOUND OF WORDS
THEN IN DESPITE OF BROODED WATCHFUL DAY
I WOULD INTO THY BOSOM POUR MY THOUGHTS
BUT AH I WILL NOT  YET I LOVE THEE WELL
AND BY MY TROTH I THINK THOU LOVEST ME WELL 
SO WELL THAT WHAT YOU BID ME UNDERTAKE

WITH ALL TRUE DUTY  ON TOWARD CALAIS HO 
SO BY A ROARING TEMPEST ON THE FLOOD
A WHOLE ARMADO OF CONVICTED SAIL

COURAGE AND COMFORT  ALL SHALL YET GO WELL 
WHAT CAN GO WELL WHEN WE HAVE RUN SO ILL
ARE WE NOT BEATEN IS NOT ANGIERS LOST
ARTHUR TAEN PRISONER DIVERS DEAR FRIENDS SLAIN
AND BLOODY ENGLAND INTO ENGLAND GONE
OERBEARING INTERRUPTION SPITE OF FRANCE
WHAT HE HATH WON THAT HATH HE FORTIFIED
SO HOT A SPEED WITH SUCH ADVICE DISPOSED
SUCH TEMPERATE ORDER IN SO FIERCE A CAUSE
DOTH WANT EXAMPLE WHO HATH READ OR HEARD
OF ANY KINDRED ACTION LIKE TO THIS
WELL COULD I BEAR THAT ENGLAND HAD THIS PRAISE
SO WE COULD FIND SOME PATTERN OF OUR SHAME 
LOOK WHO COMES HERE  A GRAVE UNTO A SOUL
HOLDING THE ETERNAL SPIRIT AGAINST HER WILL
IN THE VILE PRISON OF AFFLICTED BREATH 
I PRITHEE LADY GO AWAY WITH ME 
LO NOW I NOW SEE THE ISSUE OF YOUR PEACE 
PATIENCE GOOD LADY  COMFORT GENTLE CONSTANCE 
NO I DEFY ALL COUNSEL ALL REDRESS
BUT THAT WHICH ENDS ALL COUNSEL TRUE REDRESS
DEATH DEATH O AMIABLE LOVELY DEATH 
THOU ODOURIFEROUS STENCH  SOUND ROTTENNESS 
ARISE FORTH FROM THE COUCH OF LASTING NIGHT
THOU HATE AND TERROR TO PROSPERITY
AND I WILL KISS THY DETESTABLE BONES
AND PUT MY EYEBALLS IN THY VAULTY BROWS
AND RING THESE FINGERS WITH THY HOUSEHOLD WORMS
AND STOP THIS GAP OF BREATH WITH FULSOME DUST
AND BE A CARRION MONSTER LIKE THYSELF
COME GRIN ON ME AND I WILL THINK THOU SMILEST
AND BUSS THEE AS THY WIFE  MISERYS LOVE
O COME TO ME 
O FAIR AFFLICTION PEACE 
NO NO I WILL NOT HAVING BREATH TO CRY
O THAT MY TONGUE WERE IN THE THUNDERS MOUTH 
THEN WITH A PASSION WOULD I SHAKE THE WORLD
AND ROUSE FROM SLEEP THAT FELL ANATOMY
WHICH CANNOT HEAR A LADYS FEEBLE VOICE
WHICH SCORNS A MODERN INVOCATION 
LADY YOU UTTER MADNESS AND NOT SORROW 
THOU ART NOT HOLY TO BELIE ME SO
I AM NOT MAD THIS HAIR I TEAR IS MINE
MY NAME IS CONSTANCE I WAS GEFFREYS WIFE
YOUNG ARTHUR IS MY SON AND HE IS LOST
I AM NOT MAD I WOULD TO HEAVEN I WERE 
FOR THEN TIS LIKE I SHOULD FORGET MYSELF
O IF I COULD WHAT GRIEF SHOULD I FORGET 
PREACH SOME PHILOSOPHY TO MAKE ME MAD
AND THOU SHALT BE CANONIZED CARDINAL
FOR BEING NOT MAD BUT SENSIBLE OF GRIEF
MY REASONABLE PART PRODUCES REASON
HOW I MAY BE DELIVERD OF THESE WOES
AND TEACHES ME TO KILL OR HANG MYSELF
IF I WERE MAD I SHOULD FORGET MY SON
OR MADLY THINK A BABE OF CLOUTS WERE HE
I AM NOT MAD TOO WELL TOO WELL I FEEL
THE DIFFERENT PLAGUE OF EACH CALAMITY 
BIND UP THOSE TRESSES  O WHAT LOVE I NOTE
IN THE FAIR MULTITUDE OF THOSE HER HAIRS 
WHERE BUT BY CHANCE A SILVER DROP HATH FALLEN
EVEN TO THAT DROP TEN THOUSAND WIRY FRIENDS
DO GLUE THEMSELVES IN SOCIABLE GRIEF
LIKE TRUE INSEPARABLE FAITHFUL LOVES
STICKING TOGETHER IN CALAMITY 
TO ENGLAND IF YOU WILL 
BIND UP YOUR HAIRS 
YES THAT I WILL AND WHEREFORE WILL I DO IT
I TORE THEM FROM THEIR BONDS AND CRIED ALOUD
O THAT THESE HANDS COULD SO REDEEM MY SON
AS THEY HAVE GIVEN THESE HAIRS THEIR LIBERTY 
BUT NOW I ENVY AT THEIR LIBERTY
AND WILL AGAIN COMMIT THEM TO THEIR BONDS
BECAUSE MY POOR CHILD IS A PRISONER 
AND FATHER CARDINAL I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY
THAT WE SHALL SEE AND KNOW OUR FRIENDS IN HEAVEN
IF THAT BE TRUE I SHALL SEE MY BOY AGAIN
FOR SINCE THE BIRTH OF CAIN THE FIRST MALE CHILD
TO HIM THAT DID BUT YESTERDAY SUSPIRE
THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GRACIOUS CREATURE BORN 
BUT NOW WILL CANKERSORROW EAT MY BUD
AND CHASE THE NATIVE BEAUTY FROM HIS CHEEK
AND HE WILL LOOK AS HOLLOW AS A GHOST
AS DIM AND MEAGRE AS AN AGUES FIT
AND SO HELL DIE AND RISING SO AGAIN
WHEN I SHALL MEET HIM IN THE COURT OF HEAVEN
I SHALL NOT KNOW HIM THEREFORE NEVER NEVER
MUST I BEHOLD MY PRETTY ARTHUR MORE 
YOU HOLD TOO HEINOUS A RESPECT OF GRIEF 
HE TALKS TO ME THAT NEVER HAD A SON 
YOU ARE AS FOND OF GRIEF AS OF YOUR CHILD 
GRIEF FILLS THE ROOM UP OF MY ABSENT CHILD
LIES IN HIS BED WALKS UP AND DOWN WITH ME
PUTS ON HIS PRETTY LOOKS REPEATS HIS WORDS
REMEMBERS ME OF ALL HIS GRACIOUS PARTS
STUFFS OUT HIS VACANT GARMENTS WITH HIS FORM
THEN HAVE I REASON TO BE FOND OF GRIEF
FARE YOU WELL HAD YOU SUCH A LOSS AS I
I COULD GIVE BETTER COMFORT THAN YOU DO 
I WILL NOT KEEP THIS FORM UPON MY HEAD
WHEN THERE IS SUCH DISORDER IN MY WIT 
O LORD  MY BOY MY ARTHUR MY FAIR SON 
MY LIFE MY JOY MY FOOD MY ALL THE WORLD 
MY WIDOWCOMFORT AND MY SORROWS CURE 
I FEAR SOME OUTRAGE AND ILL FOLLOW HER 
THERES NOTHING IN THIS WORLD CAN MAKE ME JOY
LIFE IS AS TEDIOUS AS A TWICETOLD TALE
VEXING THE DULL EAR OF A DROWSY MAN
AND BITTER SHAME HATH SPOILD THE SWEET WORLDS TASTE
THAT IT YIELDS NOUGHT BUT SHAME AND BITTERNESS 
BEFORE THE CURING OF A STRONG DISEASE
EVEN IN THE INSTANT OF REPAIR AND HEALTH
THE FIT IS STRONGEST EVILS THAT TAKE LEAVE
ON THEIR DEPARTURE MOST OF ALL SHOW EVIL
WHAT HAVE YOU LOST BY LOSING OF THIS DAY
ALL DAYS OF GLORY JOY AND HAPPINESS 
IF YOU HAD WON IT CERTAINLY YOU HAD 
NO NO WHEN FORTUNE MEANS TO MEN MOST GOOD
SHE LOOKS UPON THEM WITH A THREATENING EYE 
TIS STRANGE TO THINK HOW MUCH KING JOHN HATH LOST
IN THIS WHICH HE ACCOUNTS SO CLEARLY WON
ARE NOT YOU GRIEVED THAT ARTHUR IS HIS PRISONER
AS HEARTILY AS HE IS GLAD HE HATH HIM 
YOUR MIND IS ALL AS YOUTHFUL AS YOUR BLOOD 
NOW HEAR ME SPEAK WITH A PROPHETIC SPIRIT
FOR EVEN THE BREATH OF WHAT I MEAN TO SPEAK
SHALL BLOW EACH DUST EACH STRAW EACH LITTLE RUB
OUT OF THE PATH WHICH SHALL DIRECTLY LEAD
THY FOOT TO ENGLANDS THRONE AND THEREFORE MARK 
JOHN HATH SEIZED ARTHUR AND IT CANNOT BE
THAT WHILES WARM LIFE PLAYS IN THAT INFANTS VEINS
THE MISPLACED JOHN SHOULD ENTERTAIN AN HOUR
ONE MINUTE NAY ONE QUIET BREATH OF REST 
A SCEPTRE SNATCHD WITH AN UNRULY HAND
MUST BE AS BOISTEROUSLY MAINTAIND AS GAIND
AND HE THAT STANDS UPON A SLIPPERY PLACE
MAKES NICE OF NO VILE HOLD TO STAY HIM UP
THAT JOHN MAY STAND THEN ARTHUR NEEDS MUST FALL
SO BE IT FOR IT CANNOT BE BUT SO 
BUT WHAT SHALL I GAIN BY YOUNG ARTHURS FALL
YOU IN THE RIGHT OF LADY BLANCH YOUR WIFE
MAY THEN MAKE ALL THE CLAIM THAT ARTHUR DID 
AND LOSE IT LIFE AND ALL AS ARTHUR DID 
HOW GREEN YOU ARE AND FRESH IN THIS OLD WORLD 
JOHN LAYS YOU PLOTS THE TIMES CONSPIRE WITH YOU
FOR HE THAT STEEPS HIS SAFETY IN TRUE BLOOD
SHALL FIND BUT BLOODY SAFETY AND UNTRUE 
THIS ACT SO EVILLY BORN SHALL COOL THE HEARTS
OF ALL HIS PEOPLE AND FREEZE UP THEIR ZEAL
THAT NONE SO SMALL ADVANTAGE SHALL STEP FORTH
TO CHEQUE HIS REIGN BUT THEY WILL CHERISH IT
NO NATURAL EXHALATION IN THE SKY
NO SCOPE OF NATURE NO DISTEMPERD DAY
NO COMMON WIND NO CUSTOMED EVENT
BUT THEY WILL PLUCK AWAY HIS NATURAL CAUSE
AND CALL THEM METEORS PRODIGIES AND SIGNS
ABORTIVES PRESAGES AND TONGUES OF HEAVEN
PLAINLY DENOUNCING VENGEANCE UPON JOHN 
MAY BE HE WILL NOT TOUCH YOUNG ARTHURS LIFE
BUT HOLD HIMSELF SAFE IN HIS PRISONMENT 
O SIR WHEN HE SHALL HEAR OF YOUR APPROACH
IF THAT YOUNG ARTHUR BE NOT GONE ALREADY
EVEN AT THAT NEWS HE DIES AND THEN THE HEARTS
OF ALL HIS PEOPLE SHALL REVOLT FROM HIM
AND KISS THE LIPS OF UNACQUAINTED CHANGE
AND PICK STRONG MATTER OF REVOLT AND WRATH
OUT OF THE BLOODY FINGERS ENDS OF JOHN 
METHINKS I SEE THIS HURLY ALL ON FOOT
AND O WHAT BETTER MATTER BREEDS FOR YOU
THAN I HAVE NAMED  THE BASTARD FAULCONBRIDGE
IS NOW IN ENGLAND RANSACKING THE CHURCH
OFFENDING CHARITY IF BUT A DOZEN FRENCH
WERE THERE IN ARMS THEY WOULD BE AS A CALL
TO TRAIN TEN THOUSAND ENGLISH TO THEIR SIDE
OR AS A LITTLE SNOW TUMBLED ABOUT
ANON BECOMES A MOUNTAIN  O NOBLE DAUPHIN
GO WITH ME TO THE KING TIS WONDERFUL
WHAT MAY BE WROUGHT OUT OF THEIR DISCONTENT
NOW THAT THEIR SOULS ARE TOPFUL OF OFFENCE 
FOR ENGLAND GO I WILL WHET ON THE KING 
STRONG REASONS MAKE STRONG ACTIONS LET US GO
IF YOU SAY AY THE KING WILL NOT SAY NO 
HEAT ME THESE IRONS HOT AND LOOK THOU STAND
WITHIN THE ARRAS WHEN I STRIKE MY FOOT
UPON THE BOSOM OF THE GROUND RUSH FORTH
AND BIND THE BOY WHICH YOU SHALL FIND WITH ME
FAST TO THE CHAIR BE HEEDFUL HENCE AND WATCH 
I HOPE YOUR WARRANT WILL BEAR OUT THE DEED 
UNCLEANLY SCRUPLES  FEAR NOT YOU LOOK TOT 
YOUNG LAD COME FORTH I HAVE TO SAY WITH YOU 
GOOD MORROW HUBERT 
GOOD MORROW LITTLE PRINCE 
AS LITTLE PRINCE HAVING SO GREAT A TITLE
TO BE MORE PRINCE AS MAY BE  YOU ARE SAD 
INDEED I HAVE BEEN MERRIER 
MERCY ON ME 
METHINKS NO BODY SHOULD BE SAD BUT I
YET I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN FRANCE
YOUNG GENTLEMEN WOULD BE AS SAD AS NIGHT
ONLY FOR WANTONNESS  BY MY CHRISTENDOM
SO I WERE OUT OF PRISON AND KEPT SHEEP
I SHOULD BE AS MERRY AS THE DAY IS LONG
AND SO I WOULD BE HERE BUT THAT I DOUBT
MY UNCLE PRACTISES MORE HARM TO ME
HE IS AFRAID OF ME AND I OF HIM
IS IT MY FAULT THAT I WAS GEFFREYS SON
NO INDEED IST NOT AND I WOULD TO HEAVEN
I WERE YOUR SON SO YOU WOULD LOVE ME HUBERT 
  IF I TALK TO HIM WITH HIS INNOCENT PRATE
HE WILL AWAKE MY MERCY WHICH LIES DEAD
THEREFORE I WILL BE SUDDEN AND DISPATCH 
ARE YOU SICK HUBERT YOU LOOK PALE TODAY
IN SOOTH I WOULD YOU WERE A LITTLE SICK
THAT I MIGHT SIT ALL NIGHT AND WATCH WITH YOU
I WARRANT I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU DO ME 
  HIS WORDS DO TAKE POSSESSION OF MY BOSOM 
READ HERE YOUNG ARTHUR 
HOW NOW FOOLISH RHEUM 
TURNING DISPITEOUS TORTURE OUT OF DOOR 
I MUST BE BRIEF LEST RESOLUTION DROP

TOO FAIRLY HUBERT FOR SO FOUL EFFECT
MUST YOU WITH HOT IRONS BURN OUT BOTH MINE EYES
YOUNG BOY I MUST 
AND WILL YOU
AND I WILL 
HAVE YOU THE HEART WHEN YOUR HEAD DID BUT ACHE
I KNIT MY HANDERCHER ABOUT YOUR BROWS
THE BEST I HAD A PRINCESS WROUGHT IT ME
AND I DID NEVER ASK IT YOU AGAIN
AND WITH MY HAND AT MIDNIGHT HELD YOUR HEAD
AND LIKE THE WATCHFUL MINUTES TO THE HOUR
STILL AND ANON CHEERD UP THE HEAVY TIME
SAYING WHAT LACK YOU AND WHERE LIES YOUR GRIEF
OR WHAT GOOD LOVE MAY I PERFORM FOR YOU
MANY A POOR MANS SON WOULD HAVE LIEN STILL
AND NEER HAVE SPOKE A LOVING WORD TO YOU
BUT YOU AT YOUR SICK SERVICE HAD A PRINCE 
NAY YOU MAY THINK MY LOVE WAS CRAFTY LOVE
AND CALL IT CUNNING DO AN IF YOU WILL
IF HEAVEN BE PLEASED THAT YOU MUST USE ME ILL
WHY THEN YOU MUST  WILL YOU PUT OUT MINE EYES
THESE EYES THAT NEVER DID NOR NEVER SHALL
SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU 
I HAVE SWORN TO DO IT
AND WITH HOT IRONS MUST I BURN THEM OUT 
AH NONE BUT IN THIS IRON AGE WOULD DO IT 
THE IRON OF ITSELF THOUGH HEAT REDHOT
APPROACHING NEAR THESE EYES WOULD DRINK MY TEARS
AND QUENCH HIS FIERY INDIGNATION
EVEN IN THE MATTER OF MINE INNOCENCE
NAY AFTER THAT CONSUME AWAY IN RUST
BUT FOR CONTAINING FIRE TO HARM MINE EYE 
ARE YOU MORE STUBBORNHARD THAN HAMMERD IRON
AN IF AN ANGEL SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME
AND TOLD ME HUBERT SHOULD PUT OUT MINE EYES
I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM NO TONGUE BUT HUBERTS 
COME FORTH 
DO AS I BID YOU DO 
O SAVE ME HUBERT SAVE ME  MY EYES ARE OUT
EVEN WITH THE FIERCE LOOKS OF THESE BLOODY MEN 
GIVE ME THE IRON I SAY AND BIND HIM HERE 
ALAS WHAT NEED YOU BE SO BOISTEROUSROUGH
I WILL NOT STRUGGLE I WILL STAND STONESTILL 
FOR HEAVEN SAKE HUBERT LET ME NOT BE BOUND 
NAY HEAR ME HUBERT DRIVE THESE MEN AWAY
AND I WILL SIT AS QUIET AS A LAMB
I WILL NOT STIR NOR WINCE NOR SPEAK A WORD
NOR LOOK UPON THE IRON ANGERLY
THRUST BUT THESE MEN AWAY AND ILL FORGIVE YOU
WHATEVER TORMENT YOU DO PUT ME TO 
GO STAND WITHIN LET ME ALONE WITH HIM 
I AM BEST PLEASED TO BE FROM SUCH A DEED 
ALAS I THEN HAVE CHID AWAY MY FRIEND 
HE HATH A STERN LOOK BUT A GENTLE HEART
LET HIM COME BACK THAT HIS COMPASSION MAY
GIVE LIFE TO YOURS 
COME BOY PREPARE YOURSELF 
IS THERE NO REMEDY
NONE BUT TO LOSE YOUR EYES 
O HEAVEN THAT THERE WERE BUT A MOTE IN YOURS
A GRAIN A DUST A GNAT A WANDERING HAIR
ANY ANNOYANCE IN THAT PRECIOUS SENSE 
THEN FEELING WHAT SMALL THINGS ARE BOISTEROUS THERE
YOUR VILE INTENT MUST NEEDS SEEM HORRIBLE 
IS THIS YOUR PROMISE GO TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE 
HUBERT THE UTTERANCE OF A BRACE OF TONGUES
MUST NEEDS WANT PLEADING FOR A PAIR OF EYES
LET ME NOT HOLD MY TONGUE LET ME NOT HUBERT
OR HUBERT IF YOU WILL CUT OUT MY TONGUE
SO I MAY KEEP MINE EYES O SPARE MINE EYES 
THOUGH TO NO USE BUT STILL TO LOOK ON YOU 
LO BY MY TRUTH THE INSTRUMENT IS COLD
AND WOULD NOT HARM ME 
I CAN HEAT IT BOY 
NO IN GOOD SOOTH THE FIRE IS DEAD WITH GRIEF
BEING CREATE FOR COMFORT TO BE USED
IN UNDESERVED EXTREMES SEE ELSE YOURSELF
THERE IS NO MALICE IN THIS BURNING COAL
THE BREATH OF HEAVEN HAS BLOWN HIS SPIRIT OUT
AND STREWD REPENTENT ASHES ON HIS HEAD 
BUT WITH MY BREATH I CAN REVIVE IT BOY 
AN IF YOU DO YOU WILL BUT MAKE IT BLUSH
AND GLOW WITH SHAME OF YOUR PROCEEDINGS HUBERT
NAY IT PERCHANCE WILL SPARKLE IN YOUR EYES
AND LIKE A DOG THAT IS COMPELLD TO FIGHT
SNATCH AT HIS MASTER THAT DOTH TARRE HIM ON 
ALL THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD USE TO DO ME WRONG
DENY THEIR OFFICE ONLY YOU DO LACK
THAT MERCY WHICH FIERCE FIRE AND IRON EXTENDS
CREATURES OF NOTE FOR MERCYLACKING USES 
WELL SEE TO LIVE I WILL NOT TOUCH THINE EYE
FOR ALL THE TREASURE THAT THINE UNCLE OWES
YET AM I SWORN AND I DID PURPOSE BOY
WITH THIS SAME VERY IRON TO BURN THEM OUT 
O NOW YOU LOOK LIKE HUBERT  ALL THIS WHILE
YOU WERE DISGUISED 
PEACE NO MORE  ADIEU 
YOUR UNCLE MUST NOT KNOW BUT YOU ARE DEAD
ILL FILL THESE DOGGED SPIES WITH FALSE REPORTS
AND PRETTY CHILD SLEEP DOUBTLESS AND SECURE
THAT HUBERT FOR THE WEALTH OF ALL THE WORLD
WILL NOT OFFEND THEE 
O HEAVEN  I THANK YOU HUBERT 
SILENCE NO MORE GO CLOSELY IN WITH ME
MUCH DANGER DO I UNDERGO FOR THEE 
HERE ONCE AGAIN WE SIT ONCE AGAIN CROWND
AND LOOKED UPON I HOPE WITH CHEERFUL EYES 
THIS ONCE AGAIN BUT THAT YOUR HIGHNESS PLEASED
WAS ONCE SUPERFLUOUS YOU WERE CROWND BEFORE
AND THAT HIGH ROYALTY WAS NEER PLUCKD OFF
THE FAITHS OF MEN NEER STAINED WITH REVOLT
FRESH EXPECTATION TROUBLED NOT THE LAND
WITH ANY LONGDFOR CHANGE OR BETTER STATE 
THEREFORE TO BE POSSESSD WITH DOUBLE POMP
TO GUARD A TITLE THAT WAS RICH BEFORE
TO GILD REFINED GOLD TO PAINT THE LILY
TO THROW A PERFUME ON THE VIOLET
TO SMOOTH THE ICE OR ADD ANOTHER HUE
UNTO THE RAINBOW OR WITH TAPERLIGHT
TO SEEK THE BEAUTEOUS EYE OF HEAVEN TO GARNISH
IS WASTEFUL AND RIDICULOUS EXCESS 
BUT THAT YOUR ROYAL PLEASURE MUST BE DONE
THIS ACT IS AS AN ANCIENT TALE NEW TOLD
AND IN THE LAST REPEATING TROUBLESOME
BEING URGED AT A TIME UNSEASONABLE 
IN THIS THE ANTIQUE AND WELL NOTED FACE
OF PLAIN OLD FORM IS MUCH DISFIGURED
AND LIKE A SHIFTED WIND UNTO A SAIL
IT MAKES THE COURSE OF THOUGHTS TO FETCH ABOUT
STARTLES AND FRIGHTS CONSIDERATION
MAKES SOUND OPINION SICK AND TRUTH SUSPECTED
FOR PUTTING ON SO NEW A FASHIOND ROBE 
WHEN WORKMEN STRIVE TO DO BETTER THAN WELL
THEY DO CONFOUND THEIR SKILL IN COVETOUSNESS
AND OFTENTIMES EXCUSING OF A FAULT
DOTH MAKE THE FAULT THE WORSE BY THE EXCUSE
AS PATCHES SET UPON A LITTLE BREACH
DISCREDIT MORE IN HIDING OF THE FAULT
THAN DID THE FAULT BEFORE IT WAS SO PATCHD 
TO THIS EFFECT BEFORE YOU WERE NEW CROWND
WE BREATHED OUR COUNSEL BUT IT PLEASED YOUR HIGHNESS
TO OVERBEAR IT AND WE ARE ALL WELL PLEASED
SINCE ALL AND EVERY PART OF WHAT WE WOULD
DOTH MAKE A STAND AT WHAT YOUR HIGHNESS WILL 
SOME REASONS OF THIS DOUBLE CORONATION
I HAVE POSSESSD YOU WITH AND THINK THEM STRONG
AND MORE MORE STRONG THEN LESSER IS MY FEAR
I SHALL INDUE YOU WITH MEANTIME BUT ASK
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE REFORMD THAT IS NOT WELL
AND WELL SHALL YOU PERCEIVE HOW WILLINGLY
I WILL BOTH HEAR AND GRANT YOU YOUR REQUESTS 
THEN I AS ONE THAT AM THE TONGUE OF THESE
TO SOUND THE PURPOSE OF ALL THEIR HEARTS
BOTH FOR MYSELF AND THEM BUT CHIEF OF ALL
YOUR SAFETY FOR THE WHICH MYSELF AND THEM
BEND THEIR BEST STUDIES HEARTILY REQUEST
THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF ARTHUR WHOSE RESTRAINT
DOTH MOVE THE MURMURING LIPS OF DISCONTENT
TO BREAK INTO THIS DANGEROUS ARGUMENT 
IF WHAT IN REST YOU HAVE IN RIGHT YOU HOLD
WHY THEN YOUR FEARS WHICH AS THEY SAY ATTEND
THE STEPS OF WRONG SHOULD MOVE YOU TO MEW UP
YOUR TENDER KINSMAN AND TO CHOKE HIS DAYS
WITH BARBAROUS IGNORANCE AND DENY HIS YOUTH
THE RICH ADVANTAGE OF GOOD EXERCISE
THAT THE TIMES ENEMIES MAY NOT HAVE THIS
TO GRACE OCCASIONS LET IT BE OUR SUIT
THAT YOU HAVE BID US ASK HIS LIBERTY
WHICH FOR OUR GOODS WE DO NO FURTHER ASK
THAN WHEREUPON OUR WEAL ON YOU DEPENDING
COUNTS IT YOUR WEAL HE HAVE HIS LIBERTY 
LET IT BE SO I DO COMMIT HIS YOUTH
TO YOUR DIRECTION  HUBERT WHAT NEWS WITH YOU
THIS IS THE MAN SHOULD DO THE BLOODY DEED
HE SHOWD HIS WARRANT TO A FRIEND OF MINE
THE IMAGE OF A WICKED HEINOUS FAULT
LIVES IN HIS EYE THAT CLOSE ASPECT OF HIS
DOES SHOW THE MOOD OF A MUCH TROUBLED BREAST
AND I DO FEARFULLY BELIEVE TIS DONE
WHAT WE SO FEARD HE HAD A CHARGE TO DO 
THE COLOUR OF THE KING DOTH COME AND GO
BETWEEN HIS PURPOSE AND HIS CONSCIENCE
LIKE HERALDS TWIXT TWO DREADFUL BATTLES SET
HIS PASSION IS SO RIPE IT NEEDS MUST BREAK 
AND WHEN IT BREAKS I FEAR WILL ISSUE THENCE
THE FOUL CORRUPTION OF A SWEET CHILDS DEATH 
WE CANNOT HOLD MORTALITYS STRONG HAND
GOOD LORDS ALTHOUGH MY WILL TO GIVE IS LIVING
THE SUIT WHICH YOU DEMAND IS GONE AND DEAD
HE TELLS US ARTHUR IS DECEASED TONIGHT 
INDEED WE FEARD HIS SICKNESS WAS PAST CURE 
INDEED WE HEARD HOW NEAR HIS DEATH HE WAS
BEFORE THE CHILD HIMSELF FELT HE WAS SICK
THIS MUST BE ANSWERD EITHER HERE OR HENCE 
WHY DO YOU BEND SUCH SOLEMN BROWS ON ME
THINK YOU I BEAR THE SHEARS OF DESTINY
HAVE I COMMANDMENT ON THE PULSE OF LIFE
IT IS APPARENT FOUL PLAY AND TIS SHAME
THAT GREATNESS SHOULD SO GROSSLY OFFER IT
SO THRIVE IT IN YOUR GAME  AND SO FAREWELL 
STAY YET LORD SALISBURY ILL GO WITH THEE
AND FIND THE INHERITANCE OF THIS POOR CHILD
HIS LITTLE KINGDOM OF A FORCED GRAVE 
THAT BLOOD WHICH OWED THE BREADTH OF ALL THIS ISLE
THREE FOOT OF IT DOTH HOLD BAD WORLD THE WHILE 
THIS MUST NOT BE THUS BORNE THIS WILL BREAK OUT
TO ALL OUR SORROWS AND ERE LONG I DOUBT 
THEY BURN IN INDIGNATION  I REPENT
THERE IS NO SURE FOUNDATION SET ON BLOOD
NO CERTAIN LIFE ACHIEVED BY OTHERS DEATH 
A FEARFUL EYE THOU HAST WHERE IS THAT BLOOD
THAT I HAVE SEEN INHABIT IN THOSE CHEEKS
SO FOUL A SKY CLEARS NOT WITHOUT A STORM
POUR DOWN THY WEATHER HOW GOES ALL IN FRANCE
FROM FRANCE TO ENGLAND  NEVER SUCH A POWER
FOR ANY FOREIGN PREPARATION
WAS LEVIED IN THE BODY OF A LAND 
THE COPY OF YOUR SPEED IS LEARND BY THEM
FOR WHEN YOU SHOULD BE TOLD THEY DO PREPARE
THE TIDINGS COME THAT THEY ARE ALL ARRIVED 
O WHERE HATH OUR INTELLIGENCE BEEN DRUNK
WHERE HATH IT SLEPT WHERE IS MY MOTHERS CARE
THAT SUCH AN ARMY COULD BE DRAWN IN FRANCE
AND SHE NOT HEAR OF IT
MY LIEGE HER EAR
IS STOPPD WITH DUST THE FIRST OF APRIL DIED
YOUR NOBLE MOTHER AND AS I HEAR MY LORD
THE LADY CONSTANCE IN A FRENZY DIED
THREE DAYS BEFORE BUT THIS FROM RUMOURS TONGUE
I IDLY HEARD IF TRUE OR FALSE I KNOW NOT 
WITHHOLD THY SPEED DREADFUL OCCASION 
O MAKE A LEAGUE WITH ME TILL I HAVE PLEASED
MY DISCONTENTED PEERS  WHAT  MOTHER DEAD 
HOW WILDLY THEN WALKS MY ESTATE IN FRANCE 
UNDER WHOSE CONDUCT CAME THOSE POWERS OF FRANCE
THAT THOU FOR TRUTH GIVEST OUT ARE LANDED HERE
UNDER THE DAUPHIN 
THOU HAST MADE ME GIDDY
WITH THESE ILL TIDINGS 
NOW WHAT SAYS THE WORLD
TO YOUR PROCEEDINGS DO NOT SEEK TO STUFF
MY HEAD WITH MORE ILL NEWS FOR IT IS FULL 
BUT IF YOU BE AFEARD TO HEAR THE WORST
THEN LET THE WORST UNHEARD FALL ON YOUR BEAD 
BEAR WITH ME COUSIN FOR I WAS AMAZED
UNDER THE TIDE BUT NOW I BREATHE AGAIN
ALOFT THE FLOOD AND CAN GIVE AUDIENCE
TO ANY TONGUE SPEAK IT OF WHAT IT WILL 
HOW I HAVE SPED AMONG THE CLERGYMEN
THE SUMS I HAVE COLLECTED SHALL EXPRESS 
BUT AS I TRAVELLD HITHER THROUGH THE LAND
I FIND THE PEOPLE STRANGELY FANTASIED
POSSESSD WITH RUMOURS FULL OF IDLE DREAMS
NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY FEAR BUT FULL OF FEAR
AND HERE A PROPHET THAT I BROUGHT WITH ME
FROM FORTH THE STREETS OF POMFRET WHOM I FOUND
WITH MANY HUNDREDS TREADING ON HIS HEELS
TO WHOM HE SUNG IN RUDE HARSHSOUNDING RHYMES
THAT ERE THE NEXT ASCENSIONDAY AT NOON
YOUR HIGHNESS SHOULD DELIVER UP YOUR CROWN 
THOU IDLE DREAMER WHEREFORE DIDST THOU SO
FOREKNOWING THAT THE TRUTH WILL FALL OUT SO 
HUBERT AWAY WITH HIM IMPRISON HIM
AND ON THAT DAY AT NOON WHEREON HE SAYS
I SHALL YIELD UP MY CROWN LET HIM BE HANGD 
DELIVER HIM TO SAFETY AND RETURN
FOR I MUST USE THEE 
O MY GENTLE COUSIN
HEARST THOU THE NEWS ABROAD WHO ARE ARRIVED
THE FRENCH MY LORD MENS MOUTHS ARE FULL OF IT
BESIDES I MET LORD BIGOT AND LORD SALISBURY
WITH EYES AS RED AS NEWENKINDLED FIRE
AND OTHERS MORE GOING TO SEEK THE GRAVE
OF ARTHUR WHO THEY SAY IS KILLD TONIGHT
ON YOUR SUGGESTION 
GENTLE KINSMAN GO
AND THRUST THYSELF INTO THEIR COMPANIES
I HAVE A WAY TO WIN THEIR LOVES AGAIN
BRING THEM BEFORE ME 
I WILL SEEK THEM OUT 
NAY BUT MAKE HASTE THE BETTER FOOT BEFORE 
O LET ME HAVE NO SUBJECT ENEMIES
WHEN ADVERSE FOREIGNERS AFFRIGHT MY TOWNS
WITH DREADFUL POMP OF STOUT INVASION 
BE MERCURY SET FEATHERS TO THY HEELS
AND FLY LIKE THOUGHT FROM THEM TO ME AGAIN 
THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME SHALL TEACH ME SPEED 
SPOKE LIKE A SPRIGHTFUL NOBLE GENTLEMAN 
GO AFTER HIM FOR HE PERHAPS SHALL NEED
SOME MESSENGER BETWIXT ME AND THE PEERS
AND BE THOU HE 
WITH ALL MY HEART MY LIEGE 
MY MOTHER DEAD 
MY LORD THEY SAY FIVE MOONS WERE SEEN TONIGHT
FOUR FIXED AND THE FIFTH DID WHIRL ABOUT
THE OTHER FOUR IN WONDROUS MOTION 
FIVE MOONS 
OLD MEN AND BELDAMS IN THE STREETS
DO PROPHESY UPON IT DANGEROUSLY
YOUNG ARTHURS DEATH IS COMMON IN THEIR MOUTHS
AND WHEN THEY TALK OF HIM THEY SHAKE THEIR HEADS
AND WHISPER ONE ANOTHER IN THE EAR
AND HE THAT SPEAKS DOTH GRIPE THE HEARERS WRIST
WHILST HE THAT HEARS MAKES FEARFUL ACTION
WITH WRINKLED BROWS WITH NODS WITH ROLLING EYES 
I SAW A SMITH STAND WITH HIS HAMMER THUS
THE WHILST HIS IRON DID ON THE ANVIL COOL
WITH OPEN MOUTH SWALLOWING A TAILORS NEWS
WHO WITH HIS SHEARS AND MEASURE IN HIS HAND
STANDING ON SLIPPERS WHICH HIS NIMBLE HASTE
HAD FALSELY THRUST UPON CONTRARY FEET
TOLD OF A MANY THOUSAND WARLIKE FRENCH
THAT WERE EMBATTAILED AND RANKD IN KENT
ANOTHER LEAN UNWASHD ARTIFICER
CUTS OFF HIS TALE AND TALKS OF ARTHURS DEATH 
WHY SEEKST THOU TO POSSESS ME WITH THESE FEARS
WHY URGEST THOU SO OFT YOUNG ARTHURS DEATH
THY HAND HATH MURDERD HIM I HAD A MIGHTY CAUSE
TO WISH HIM DEAD BUT THOU HADST NONE TO KILL HIM 
NO HAD MY LORD  WHY DID YOU NOT PROVOKE ME
IT IS THE CURSE OF KINGS TO BE ATTENDED
BY SLAVES THAT TAKE THEIR HUMOURS FOR A WARRANT
TO BREAK WITHIN THE BLOODY HOUSE OF LIFE
AND ON THE WINKING OF AUTHORITY
TO UNDERSTAND A LAW TO KNOW THE MEANING
OF DANGEROUS MAJESTY WHEN PERCHANCE IT FROWNS
MORE UPON HUMOUR THAN ADVISED RESPECT 
HERE IS YOUR HAND AND SEAL FOR WHAT I DID 
O WHEN THE LAST ACCOUNT TWIXT HEAVEN AND EARTH
IS TO BE MADE THEN SHALL THIS HAND AND SEAL
WITNESS AGAINST US TO DAMNATION 
HOW OFT THE SIGHT OF MEANS TO DO ILL DEEDS
MAKE DEEDS ILL DONE  HADST NOT THOU BEEN BY
A FELLOW BY THE HAND OF NATURE MARKD
QUOTED AND SIGND TO DO A DEED OF SHAME
THIS MURDER HAD NOT COME INTO MY MIND
BUT TAKING NOTE OF THY ABHORRD ASPECT
FINDING THEE FIT FOR BLOODY VILLANY
APT LIABLE TO BE EMPLOYD IN DANGER
I FAINTLY BROKE WITH THEE OF ARTHURS DEATH
AND THOU TO BE ENDEARED TO A KING
MADE IT NO CONSCIENCE TO DESTROY A PRINCE 
MY LORD 
HADST THOU BUT SHOOK THY HEAD OR MADE A PAUSE
WHEN I SPAKE DARKLY WHAT I PURPOSED
OR TURND AN EYE OF DOUBT UPON MY FACE
AS BID ME TELL MY TALE IN EXPRESS WORDS
DEEP SHAME HAD STRUCK ME DUMB MADE ME BREAK OFF
AND THOSE THY FEARS MIGHT HAVE WROUGHT FEARS IN ME
BUT THOU DIDST UNDERSTAND ME BY MY SIGNS
AND DIDST IN SIGNS AGAIN PARLEY WITH SIN
YEA WITHOUT STOP DIDST LET THY HEART CONSENT
AND CONSEQUENTLY THY RUDE HAND TO ACT
THE DEED WHICH BOTH OUR TONGUES HELD VILE TO NAME 
OUT OF MY SIGHT AND NEVER SEE ME MORE 
MY NOBLES LEAVE ME AND MY STATE IS BRAVED
EVEN AT MY GATES WITH RANKS OF FOREIGN POWERS
NAY IN THE BODY OF THIS FLESHLY LAND
THIS KINGDOM THIS CONFINE OF BLOOD AND BREATH
HOSTILITY AND CIVIL TUMULT REIGNS
BETWEEN MY CONSCIENCE AND MY COUSINS DEATH 
ARM YOU AGAINST YOUR OTHER ENEMIES
ILL MAKE A PEACE BETWEEN YOUR SOUL AND YOU 
YOUNG ARTHUR IS ALIVE THIS HAND OF MINE
IS YET A MAIDEN AND AN INNOCENT HAND
NOT PAINTED WITH THE CRIMSON SPOTS OF BLOOD 
WITHIN THIS BOSOM NEVER ENTERD YET
THE DREADFUL MOTION OF A MURDEROUS THOUGHT
AND YOU HAVE SLANDERD NATURE IN MY FORM
WHICH HOWSOEVER RUDE EXTERIORLY
IS YET THE COVER OF A FAIRER MIND
THAN TO BE BUTCHER OF AN INNOCENT CHILD 
DOTH ARTHUR LIVE O HASTE THEE TO THE PEERS
THROW THIS REPORT ON THEIR INCENSED RAGE
AND MAKE THEM TAME TO THEIR OBEDIENCE 
FORGIVE THE COMMENT THAT MY PASSION MADE
UPON THY FEATURE FOR MY RAGE WAS BLIND
AND FOUL IMAGINARY EYES OF BLOOD
PRESENTED THEE MORE HIDEOUS THAN THOU ART 
O ANSWER NOT BUT TO MY CLOSET BRING
THE ANGRY LORDS WITH ALL EXPEDIENT HASTE 
I CONJURE THEE BUT SLOWLY RUN MORE FAST 
THE WALL IS HIGH AND YET WILL I LEAP DOWN
GOOD GROUND BE PITIFUL AND HURT ME NOT 
THERES FEW OR NONE DO KNOW ME IF THEY DID
THIS SHIPBOYS SEMBLANCE HATH DISGUISED ME QUITE 
I AM AFRAID AND YET ILL VENTURE IT 
IF I GET DOWN AND DO NOT BREAK MY LIMBS
ILL FIND A THOUSAND SHIFTS TO GET AWAY
AS GOOD TO DIE AND GO AS DIE AND STAY 
O ME  MY UNCLES SPIRIT IS IN THESE STONES
HEAVEN TAKE MY SOUL AND ENGLAND KEEP MY BONES

AND IT SHALL BE AS ALL THE OCEAN
ENOUGH TO STIFLE SUCH A VILLAIN UP 
I DO SUSPECT THEE VERY GRIEVOUSLY 
IF I IN ACT CONSENT OR SIN OF THOUGHT
BE GUILTY OF THE STEALING THAT SWEET BREATH
WHICH WAS EMBOUNDED IN THIS BEAUTEOUS CLAY
LET HELL WANT PAINS ENOUGH TO TORTURE ME 
I LEFT HIM WELL 
GO BEAR HIM IN THINE ARMS 
I AM AMAZED METHINKS AND LOSE MY WAY
AMONG THE THORNS AND DANGERS OF THIS WORLD 
HOW EASY DOST THOU TAKE ALL ENGLAND UP 
FROM FORTH THIS MORSEL OF DEAD ROYALTY
THE LIFE THE RIGHT AND TRUTH OF ALL THIS REALM
IS FLED TO HEAVEN AND ENGLAND NOW IS LEFT
TO TUG AND SCAMBLE AND TO PART BY THE TEETH
THE UNOWED INTEREST OF PROUDSWELLING STATE 
NOW FOR THE BAREPICKD BONE OF MAJESTY
DOTH DOGGED WAR BRISTLE HIS ANGRY CREST
AND SNARLETH IN THE GENTLE EYES OF PEACE
NOW POWERS FROM HOME AND DISCONTENTS AT HOME
MEET IN ONE LINE AND VAST CONFUSION WAITS
AS DOTH A RAVEN ON A SICKFALLN BEAST
THE IMMINENT DECAY OF WRESTED POMP 
NOW HAPPY HE WHOSE CLOAK AND CINCTURE CAN
HOLD OUT THIS TEMPEST  BEAR AWAY THAT CHILD
AND FOLLOW ME WITH SPEED ILL TO THE KING
A THOUSAND BUSINESSES ARE BRIEF IN HAND
AND HEAVEN ITSELF DOTH FROWN UPON THE LAND 
THUS HAVE I YIELDED UP INTO YOUR HAND
THE CIRCLE OF MY GLORY 
TAKE AGAIN
FROM THIS MY HAND AS HOLDING OF THE POPE
YOUR SOVEREIGN GREATNESS AND AUTHORITY 
NOW KEEP YOUR HOLY WORD GO MEET THE FRENCH
AND FROM HIS HOLINESS USE ALL YOUR POWER
TO STOP THEIR MARCHES FORE WE ARE INFLAMED 
OUR DISCONTENTED COUNTIES DO REVOLT
OUR PEOPLE QUARREL WITH OBEDIENCE
SWEARING ALLEGIANCE AND THE LOVE OF SOUL
TO STRANGER BLOOD TO FOREIGN ROYALTY 
THIS INUNDATION OF MISTEMPERD HUMOUR
RESTS BY YOU ONLY TO BE QUALIFIED
THEN PAUSE NOT FOR THE PRESENT TIMES SO SICK
THAT PRESENT MEDICINE MUST BE MINISTERD
OR OVERTHROW INCURABLE ENSUES 
IT WAS MY BREATH THAT BLEW THIS TEMPEST UP
UPON YOUR STUBBORN USAGE OF THE POPE
BUT SINCE YOU ARE A GENTLE CONVERTITE
MY TONGUE SHALL HUSH AGAIN THIS STORM OF WAR
AND MAKE FAIR WEATHER IN YOUR BLUSTERING LAND 
ON THIS ASCENSIONDAY REMEMBER WELL
UPON YOUR OATH OF SERVICE TO THE POPE
GO I TO MAKE THE FRENCH LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS 
IS THIS ASCENSIONDAY DID NOT THE PROPHET
SAY THAT BEFORE ASCENSIONDAY AT NOON
MY CROWN I SHOULD GIVE OFF EVEN SO I HAVE
I DID SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE ON CONSTRAINT
BUT HEAVEN BE THANKD IT IS BUT VOLUNTARY 
ALL KENT HATH YIELDED NOTHING THERE HOLDS OUT
BUT DOVER CASTLE LONDON HATH RECEIVED
LIKE A KIND HOST THE DAUPHIN AND HIS POWERS
YOUR NOBLES WILL NOT HEAR YOU BUT ARE GONE
TO OFFER SERVICE TO YOUR ENEMY
AND WILD AMAZEMENT HURRIES UP AND DOWN
THE LITTLE NUMBER OF YOUR DOUBTFUL FRIENDS 
WOULD NOT MY LORDS RETURN TO ME AGAIN
AFTER THEY HEARD YOUNG ARTHUR WAS ALIVE
THEY FOUND HIM DEAD AND CAST INTO THE STREETS
AN EMPTY CASKET WHERE THE JEWEL OF LIFE
BY SOME DAMND HAND WAS ROBBD AND TAEN AWAY 
THAT VILLAIN HUBERT TOLD ME HE DID LIVE 
SO ON MY SOUL HE DID FOR AUGHT HE KNEW 
BUT WHEREFORE DO YOU DROOP WHY LOOK YOU SAD
BE GREAT IN ACT AS YOU HAVE BEEN IN THOUGHT
LET NOT THE WORLD SEE FEAR AND SAD DISTRUST
GOVERN THE MOTION OF A KINGLY EYE
BE STIRRING AS THE TIME BE FIRE WITH FIRE
THREATEN THE THREATENER AND OUTFACE THE BROW
OF BRAGGING HORROR SO SHALL INFERIOR EYES
THAT BORROW THEIR BEHAVIORS FROM THE GREAT
GROW GREAT BY YOUR EXAMPLE AND PUT ON
THE DAUNTLESS SPIRIT OF RESOLUTION 
AWAY AND GLISTER LIKE THE GOD OF WAR
WHEN HE INTENDETH TO BECOME THE FIELD
SHOW BOLDNESS AND ASPIRING CONFIDENCE 
WHAT SHALL THEY SEEK THE LION IN HIS DEN
AND FRIGHT HIM THERE AND MAKE HIM TREMBLE THERE
O LET IT NOT BE SAID FORAGE AND RUN
TO MEET DISPLEASURE FARTHER FROM THE DOORS
AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM ERE HE COMES SO NIGH 
THE LEGATE OF THE POPE HATH BEEN WITH ME
AND I HAVE MADE A HAPPY PEACE WITH HIM
AND HE HATH PROMISED TO DISMISS THE POWERS
LED BY THE DAUPHIN 
O INGLORIOUS LEAGUE 
SHALL WE UPON THE FOOTING OF OUR LAND
SEND FAIRPLAY ORDERS AND MAKE COMPROMISE
INSINUATION PARLEY AND BASE TRUCE
TO ARMS INVASIVE SHALL A BEARDLESS BOY
A COCKERD SILKEN WANTON BRAVE OUR FIELDS
AND FLESH HIS SPIRIT IN A WARLIKE SOIL
MOCKING THE AIR WITH COLOURS IDLY SPREAD
AND FIND NO CHEQUE LET US MY LIEGE TO ARMS
PERCHANCE THE CARDINAL CANNOT MAKE YOUR PEACE
OR IF HE DO LET IT AT LEAST BE SAID
THEY SAW WE HAD A PURPOSE OF DEFENCE 
HAVE THOU THE ORDERING OF THIS PRESENT TIME 
AWAY THEN WITH GOOD COURAGE  YET I KNOW
OUR PARTY MAY WELL MEET A PROUDER FOE 
MY LORD MELUN LET THIS BE COPIED OUT
AND KEEP IT SAFE FOR OUR REMEMBRANCE
RETURN THE PRECEDENT TO THESE LORDS AGAIN
THAT HAVING OUR FAIR ORDER WRITTEN DOWN
BOTH THEY AND WE PERUSING OER THESE NOTES
MAY KNOW WHEREFORE WE TOOK THE SACRAMENT
AND KEEP OUR FAITHS FIRM AND INVIOLABLE 
UPON OUR SIDES IT NEVER SHALL BE BROKEN 
AND NOBLE DAUPHIN ALBEIT WE SWEAR
A VOLUNTARY ZEAL AND AN UNURGED FAITH
TO YOUR PROCEEDINGS YET BELIEVE ME PRINCE
I AM NOT GLAD THAT SUCH A SORE OF TIME
SHOULD SEEK A PLASTER BY CONTEMND REVOLT
AND HEAL THE INVETERATE CANKER OF ONE WOUND
BY MAKING MANY  O IT GRIEVES MY SOUL
THAT I MUST DRAW THIS METAL FROM MY SIDE
TO BE A WIDOWMAKER  O AND THERE
WHERE HONOURABLE RESCUE AND DEFENCE
CRIES OUT UPON THE NAME OF SALISBURY 
BUT SUCH IS THE INFECTION OF THE TIME
THAT FOR THE HEALTH AND PHYSIC OF OUR RIGHT
WE CANNOT DEAL BUT WITH THE VERY HAND
OF STERN INJUSTICE AND CONFUSED WRONG 
AND IST NOT PITY O MY GRIEVED FRIENDS
THAT WE THE SONS AND CHILDREN OF THIS ISLE
WERE BORN TO SEE SO SAD AN HOUR AS THIS
WHEREIN WE STEP AFTER A STRANGER MARCH
UPON HER GENTLE BOSOM AND FILL UP
HER ENEMIES RANKS I MUST WITHDRAW AND WEEP
UPON THE SPOT OF THIS ENFORCED CAUSE 
TO GRACE THE GENTRY OF A LAND REMOTE
AND FOLLOW UNACQUAINTED COLOURS HERE
WHAT HERE O NATION THAT THOU COULDST REMOVE 
THAT NEPTUNES ARMS WHO CLIPPETH THEE ABOUT
WOULD BEAR THEE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THYSELF
AND GRAPPLE THEE UNTO A PAGAN SHORE
WHERE THESE TWO CHRISTIAN ARMIES MIGHT COMBINE
THE BLOOD OF MALICE IN A VEIN OF LEAGUE
AND NOT TO SPEND IT SO UNNEIGHBOURLY 
A NOBLE TEMPER DOST THOU SHOW IN THIS
AND GREAT AFFECTIONS WRESTLING IN THY BOSOM
DOTH MAKE AN EARTHQUAKE OF NOBILITY 
O WHAT A NOBLE COMBAT HAST THOU FOUGHT
BETWEEN COMPULSION AND A BRAVE RESPECT 
LET ME WIPE OFF THIS HONOURABLE DEW
THAT SILVERLY DOTH PROGRESS ON THY CHEEKS
MY HEART HATH MELTED AT A LADYS TEARS
BEING AN ORDINARY INUNDATION
BUT THIS EFFUSION OF SUCH MANLY DROPS
THIS SHOWER BLOWN UP BY TEMPEST OF THE SOUL
STARTLES MINE EYES AND MAKES ME MORE AMAZED
THAN HAD I SEEN THE VAULTY TOP OF HEAVEN
FIGURED QUITE OER WITH BURNING METEORS 
LIFT UP THY BROW RENOWNED SALISBURY
AND WITH A GREAT HEART HEAVE AWAY THE STORM
COMMEND THESE WATERS TO THOSE BABY EYES
THAT NEVER SAW THE GIANT WORLD ENRAGED
NOR MET WITH FORTUNE OTHER THAN AT FEASTS
FULL OF WARM BLOOD OF MIRTH OF GOSSIPING 
COME COME FOR THOU SHALT THRUST THY HAND AS DEEP
INTO THE PURSE OF RICH PROSPERITY
AS LEWIS HIMSELF SO NOBLES SHALL YOU ALL
THAT KNIT YOUR SINEWS TO THE STRENGTH OF MINE 
AND EVEN THERE METHINKS AN ANGEL SPAKE

TO GIVE US WARRANT FROM THE HAND OF HEAVEN
AND ON OUR ACTIONS SET THE NAME OF RIGHT
WITH HOLY BREATH 
HAIL NOBLE PRINCE OF FRANCE 
THE NEXT IS THIS KING JOHN HATH RECONCILED
HIMSELF TO ROME HIS SPIRIT IS COME IN
THAT SO STOOD OUT AGAINST THE HOLY CHURCH

THEREFORE THY THREATENING COLOURS NOW WIND UP
AND TAME THE SAVAGE SPIRIT OF WILD WAR
THAT LIKE A LION FOSTERD UP AT HAND

AND BE NO FURTHER HARMFUL THAN IN SHOW 
YOUR GRACE SHALL PARDON ME I WILL NOT BACK
I AM TOO HIGHBORN TO BE PROPERTIED
TO BE A SECONDARY AT CONTROL
OR USEFUL SERVINGMAN AND INSTRUMENT
TO ANY SOVEREIGN STATE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
YOUR BREATH FIRST KINDLED THE DEAD COAL OF WARS
BETWEEN THIS CHASTISED KINGDOM AND MYSELF
AND BROUGHT IN MATTER THAT SHOULD FEED THIS FIRE
AND NOW TIS FAR TOO HUGE TO BE BLOWN OUT
WITH THAT SAME WEAK WIND WHICH ENKINDLED IT 
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO KNOW THE FACE OF RIGHT
ACQUAINTED ME WITH INTEREST TO THIS LAND
YEA THRUST THIS ENTERPRISE INTO MY HEART
AND COME YE NOW TO TELL ME JOHN HATH MADE
HIS PEACE WITH ROME WHAT IS THAT PEACE TO ME

AND SUCH AS TO MY CLAIM ARE LIABLE
SWEAT IN THIS BUSINESS AND MAINTAIN THIS WAR
HAVE I NOT HEARD THESE ISLANDERS SHOUT OUT
VIVE LE ROI  AS I HAVE BANKD THEIR TOWNS
HAVE I NOT HERE THE BEST CARDS FOR THE GAME
TO WIN THIS EASY MATCH PLAYD FOR A CROWN
AND SHALL I NOW GIVE OER THE YIELDED SET
NO NO ON MY SOUL IT NEVER SHALL BE SAID 
YOU LOOK BUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS WORK 
OUTSIDE OR INSIDE I WILL NOT RETURN
TILL MY ATTEMPT SO MUCH BE GLORIFIED
AS TO MY AMPLE HOPE WAS PROMISED
BEFORE I DREW THIS GALLANT HEAD OF WAR
AND CULLD THESE FIERY SPIRITS FROM THE WORLD
TO OUTLOOK CONQUEST AND TO WIN RENOWN
EVEN IN THE JAWS OF DANGER AND OF DEATH 
WHAT LUSTY TRUMPET THUS DOTH SUMMON US
ACCORDING TO THE FAIR PLAY OF THE WORLD
LET ME HAVE AUDIENCE I AM SENT TO SPEAK
MY HOLY LORD OF MILAN FROM THE KING
I COME TO LEARN HOW YOU HAVE DEALT FOR HIM
AND AS YOU ANSWER I DO KNOW THE SCOPE
AND WARRANT LIMITED UNTO MY TONGUE 
THE DAUPHIN IS TOO WILFULOPPOSITE
AND WILL NOT TEMPORIZE WITH MY ENTREATIES

BY ALL THE BLOOD THAT EVER FURY BREATHED
THE YOUTH SAYS WELL  NOW HEAR OUR ENGLISH KING
FOR THUS HIS ROYALTY DOTH SPEAK IN ME 
HE IS PREPARED AND REASON TOO HE SHOULD
THIS APISH AND UNMANNERLY APPROACH
THIS HARNESSD MASQUE AND UNADVISED REVEL
THIS UNHAIRD SAUCINESS AND BOYISH TROOPS
THE KING DOTH SMILE AT AND IS WELL PREPARED
TO WHIP THIS DWARFISH WAR THESE PIGMY ARMS
FROM OUT THE CIRCLE OF HIS TERRITORIES 
THAT HAND WHICH HAD THE STRENGTH EVEN AT YOUR DOOR
TO CUDGEL YOU AND MAKE YOU TAKE THE HATCH
TO DIVE LIKE BUCKETS IN CONCEALED WELLS
TO CROUCH IN LITTER OF YOUR STABLE PLANKS
TO LIE LIKE PAWNS LOCKD UP IN CHESTS AND TRUNKS
TO HUG WITH SWINE TO SEEK SWEET SAFETY OUT
IN VAULTS AND PRISONS AND TO THRILL AND SHAKE
EVEN AT THE CRYING OF YOUR NATIONS CROW
THINKING HIS VOICE AN ARMED ENGLISHMAN
SHALL THAT VICTORIOUS HAND BE FEEBLED HERE
THAT IN YOUR CHAMBERS GAVE YOU CHASTISEMENT
NO KNOW THE GALLANT MONARCH IS IN ARMS
AND LIKE AN EAGLE OER HIS AERY TOWERS
TO SOUSE ANNOYANCE THAT COMES NEAR HIS NEST 
AND YOU DEGENERATE YOU INGRATE REVOLTS
YOU BLOODY NEROES RIPPING UP THE WOMB
OF YOUR DEAR MOTHER ENGLAND BLUSH FOR SHAME
FOR YOUR OWN LADIES AND PALEVISAGED MAIDS
LIKE AMAZONS COME TRIPPING AFTER DRUMS
THEIR THIMBLES INTO ARMED GAUNTLETS CHANGE
THEIR NEEDLES TO LANCES AND THEIR GENTLE HEARTS
TO FIERCE AND BLOODY INCLINATION 
THERE END THY BRAVE AND TURN THY FACE IN PEACE
WE GRANT THOU CANST OUTSCOLD US FARE THEE WELL
WE HOLD OUR TIME TOO PRECIOUS TO BE SPENT
WITH SUCH A BRABBLER 
GIVE ME LEAVE TO SPEAK 
NO I WILL SPEAK

STRIKE UP THE DRUMS AND LET THE TONGUE OF WAR
PLEAD FOR OUR INTEREST AND OUR BEING HERE 
INDEED YOUR DRUMS BEING BEATEN WILL CRY OUT
AND SO SHALL YOU BEING BEATEN DO BUT START
AN ECHO WITH THE CLAMOUR OF THY DRUM
AND EVEN AT HAND A DRUM IS READY BRACED
THAT SHALL REVERBERATE ALL AS LOUD AS THINE
SOUND BUT ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SHALL
AS LOUD AS THINE RATTLE THE WELKINS EAR
AND MOCK THE DEEPMOUTHD THUNDER FOR AT HAND
NOT TRUSTING TO THIS HALTING LEGATE HERE

WEAKNESS POSSESSETH ME AND I AM FAINT 
I DID NOT THINK THE KING SO STORED WITH FRIENDS

IF THEY MISCARRY WE MISCARRY TOO 
THAT MISBEGOTTEN DEVIL FAULCONBRIDGE
IN SPITE OF SPITE ALONE UPHOLDS THE DAY 
THEY SAY KING JOHN SORE SICK HATH LEFT THE FIELD 
LEAD ME TO THE REVOLTS OF ENGLAND HERE 
WHEN WE WERE HAPPY WE HAD OTHER NAMES 
IT IS THE COUNT MELUN 
WOUNDED TO DEATH 
FLY NOBLE ENGLISH YOU ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD
UNTHREAD THE RUDE EYE OF REBELLION
AND WELCOME HOME AGAIN DISCARDED FAITH 
SEEK OUT KING JOHN AND FALL BEFORE HIS FEET
FOR IF THE FRENCH BE LORDS OF THIS LOUD DAY

WHY SHOULD I THEN BE FALSE SINCE IT IS TRUE
THAT I MUST DIE HERE AND LIVE HENCE BY TRUTH
I SAY AGAIN IF LEWIS DO WIN THE DAY
HE IS FORSWORN IF EER THOSE EYES OF YOURS
BEHOLD ANOTHER DAY BREAK IN THE EAST
BUT EVEN THIS NIGHT WHOSE BLACK CONTAGIOUS BREATH
ALREADY SMOKES ABOUT THE BURNING CREST
OF THE OLD FEEBLE AND DAYWEARIED SUN
EVEN THIS ILL NIGHT YOUR BREATHING SHALL EXPIRE
PAYING THE FINE OF RATED TREACHERY
EVEN WITH A TREACHEROUS FINE OF ALL YOUR LIVES
IF LEWIS BY YOUR ASSISTANCE WIN THE DAY 
COMMEND ME TO ONE HUBERT WITH YOUR KING
THE LOVE OF HIM AND THIS RESPECT BESIDES
FOR THAT MY GRANDSIRE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
AWAKES MY CONSCIENCE TO CONFESS ALL THIS 
IN LIEU WHEREOF I PRAY YOU BEAR ME HENCE
FROM FORTH THE NOISE AND RUMOUR OF THE FIELD
WHERE I MAY THINK THE REMNANT OF MY THOUGHTS
IN PEACE AND PART THIS BODY AND MY SOUL
WITH CONTEMPLATION AND DEVOUT DESIRES 
WE DO BELIEVE THEE AND BESHREW MY SOUL
BUT I DO LOVE THE FAVOUR AND THE FORM
OF THIS MOST FAIR OCCASION BY THE WHICH
WE WILL UNTREAD THE STEPS OF DAMNED FLIGHT
AND LIKE A BATED AND RETIRED FLOOD
LEAVING OUR RANKNESS AND IRREGULAR COURSE
STOOP LOW WITHIN THOSE BOUNDS WE HAVE OERLOOKD

MY ARM SHALL GIVE THEE HELP TO BEAR THEE HENCE
FOR I DO SEE THE CRUEL PANGS OF DEATH
RIGHT IN THINE EYE  AWAY MY FRIENDS  NEW FLIGHT
AND HAPPY NEWNESS THAT INTENDS OLD RIGHT 
THE SUN OF HEAVEN METHOUGHT WAS LOATH TO SET

OURSELVES WELL SINEWED TO OUR DEFENCE

AND WE SHALL SHOCK THEM  NOUGHT SHALL MAKE US RUE
IF ENGLAND TO ITSELF DO REST BUT TRUE
