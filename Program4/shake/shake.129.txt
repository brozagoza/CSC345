HERE TO MAKE GOOD THE BOISTEROUS LATE APPEAL
WHICH THEN OUR LEISURE WOULD NOT LET US HEAR
AGAINST THE DUKE OF NORFOLK THOMAS MOWBRAY
I HAVE MY LIEGE 
TELL ME MOREOVER HAST THOU SOUNDED HIM
IF HE APPEAL THE DUKE ON ANCIENT MALICE
OR WORTHILY AS A GOOD SUBJECT SHOULD
ON SOME KNOWN GROUND OF TREACHERY IN HIM
AS NEAR AS I COULD SIFT HIM ON THAT ARGUMENT
ON SOME APPARENT DANGER SEEN IN HIM
AIMD AT YOUR HIGHNESS NO INVETERATE MALICE 
THEN CALL THEM TO OUR PRESENCE FACE TO FACE
AND FROWNING BROW TO BROW OURSELVES WILL HEAR
THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED FREELY SPEAK
HIGHSTOMACHD ARE THEY BOTH AND FULL OF IRE
IN RAGE DEAF AS THE SEA HASTY AS FIRE 
MANY YEARS OF HAPPY DAYS BEFAL
MY GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN MY MOST LOVING LIEGE 
EACH DAY STILL BETTER OTHERS HAPPINESS
UNTIL THE HEAVENS ENVYING EARTHS GOOD HAP
ADD AN IMMORTAL TITLE TO YOUR CROWN 
WE THANK YOU BOTH YET ONE BUT FLATTERS US
AS WELL APPEARETH BY THE CAUSE YOU COME
NAMELY TO APPEAL EACH OTHER OF HIGH TREASON 
COUSIN OF HEREFORD WHAT DOST THOU OBJECT
AGAINST THE DUKE OF NORFOLK THOMAS MOWBRAY
FIRST HEAVEN BE THE RECORD TO MY SPEECH 
IN THE DEVOTION OF A SUBJECTS LOVE
TENDERING THE PRECIOUS SAFETY OF MY PRINCE
AND FREE FROM OTHER MISBEGOTTEN HATE
COME I APPELLANT TO THIS PRINCELY PRESENCE 
NOW THOMAS MOWBRAY DO I TURN TO THEE
AND MARK MY GREETING WELL FOR WHAT I SPEAK
MY BODY SHALL MAKE GOOD UPON THIS EARTH
OR MY DIVINE SOUL ANSWER IT IN HEAVEN 
THOU ART A TRAITOR AND A MISCREANT
TOO GOOD TO BE SO AND TOO BAD TO LIVE
SINCE THE MORE FAIR AND CRYSTAL IS THE SKY
THE UGLIER SEEM THE CLOUDS THAT IN IT FLY 
ONCE MORE THE MORE TO AGGRAVATE THE NOTE
WITH A FOUL TRAITORS NAME STUFF I THY THROAT
AND WISH SO PLEASE MY SOVEREIGN ERE I MOVE
WHAT MY TONGUE SPEAKS MY RIGHT DRAWN SWORD MAY PROVE 
LET NOT MY COLD WORDS HERE ACCUSE MY ZEAL
TIS NOT THE TRIAL OF A WOMANS WAR
THE BITTER CLAMOUR OF TWO EAGER TONGUES
CAN ARBITRATE THIS CAUSE BETWIXT US TWAIN
THE BLOOD IS HOT THAT MUST BE COOLD FOR THIS
YET CAN I NOT OF SUCH TAME PATIENCE BOAST
AS TO BE HUSHD AND NOUGHT AT ALL TO SAY
FIRST THE FAIR REVERENCE OF YOUR HIGHNESS CURBS ME
FROM GIVING REINS AND SPURS TO MY FREE SPEECH
WHICH ELSE WOULD POST UNTIL IT HAD RETURND
THESE TERMS OF TREASON DOUBLED DOWN HIS THROAT 
SETTING ASIDE HIS HIGH BLOODS ROYALTY
AND LET HIM BE NO KINSMAN TO MY LIEGE
I DO DEFY HIM AND I SPIT AT HIM
CALL HIM A SLANDEROUS COWARD AND A VILLAIN
WHICH TO MAINTAIN I WOULD ALLOW HIM ODDS
AND MEET HIM WERE I TIED TO RUN AFOOT
EVEN TO THE FROZEN RIDGES OF THE ALPS
OR ANY OTHER GROUND INHABITABLE
WHERE EVER ENGLISHMAN DURST SET HIS FOOT 
MEAN TIME LET THIS DEFEND MY LOYALTY
BY ALL MY HOPES MOST FALSELY DOTH HE LIE 
PALE TREMBLING COWARD THERE I THROW MY GAGE
DISCLAIMING HERE THE KINDRED OF THE KING
AND LAY ASIDE MY HIGH BLOODS ROYALTY
WHICH FEAR NOT REVERENCE MAKES THEE TO EXCEPT 
IF GUILTY DREAD HAVE LEFT THEE SO MUCH STRENGTH
AS TO TAKE UP MINE HONOURS PAWN THEN STOOP
BY THAT AND ALL THE RITES OF KNIGHTHOOD ELSE
WILL I MAKE GOOD AGAINST THEE ARM TO ARM
WHAT I HAVE SPOKE OR THOU CANST WORSE DEVISE 
I TAKE IT UP AND BY THAT SWORD I SWEAR
WHICH GENTLY LAID MY KNIGHTHOOD ON MY SHOULDER
ILL ANSWER THEE IN ANY FAIR DEGREE
OR CHIVALROUS DESIGN OF KNIGHTLY TRIAL
AND WHEN I MOUNT ALIVE MAY I NOT LIGHT
IF I BE TRAITOR OR UNJUSTLY FIGHT 
WHAT DOTH OUR COUSIN LAY TO MOWBRAYS CHARGE
IT MUST BE GREAT THAT CAN INHERIT US
SO MUCH AS OF A THOUGHT OF ILL IN HIM 
LOOK WHAT I SPEAK MY LIFE SHALL PROVE IT TRUE
THAT MOWBRAY HATH RECEIVED EIGHT THOUSAND NOBLES
IN NAME OF LENDINGS FOR YOUR HIGHNESS SOLDIERS
THE WHICH HE HATH DETAIND FOR LEWD EMPLOYMENTS
LIKE A FALSE TRAITOR AND INJURIOUS VILLAIN 
BESIDES I SAY AND WILL IN BATTLE PROVE
OR HERE OR ELSEWHERE TO THE FURTHEST VERGE
THAT EVER WAS SURVEYD BY ENGLISH EYE
THAT ALL THE TREASONS FOR THESE EIGHTEEN YEARS
COMPLOTTED AND CONTRIVED IN THIS LAND
FETCH FROM FALSE MOWBRAY THEIR FIRST HEAD AND SPRING 
FURTHER I SAY AND FURTHER WILL MAINTAIN
UPON HIS BAD LIFE TO MAKE ALL THIS GOOD
THAT HE DID PLOT THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTERS DEATH
SUGGEST HIS SOONBELIEVING ADVERSARIES
AND CONSEQUENTLY LIKE A TRAITOR COWARD
SLUICED OUT HIS INNOCENT SOUL THROUGH STREAMS OF BLOOD
WHICH BLOOD LIKE SACRIFICING ABELS CRIES
EVEN FROM THE TONGUELESS CAVERNS OF THE EARTH
TO ME FOR JUSTICE AND ROUGH CHASTISEMENT
AND BY THE GLORIOUS WORTH OF MY DESCENT
THIS ARM SHALL DO IT OR THIS LIFE BE SPENT 
HOW HIGH A PITCH HIS RESOLUTION SOARS 
THOMAS OF NORFOLK WHAT SAYST THOU TO THIS
O LET MY SOVEREIGN TURN AWAY HIS FACE
AND BID HIS EARS A LITTLE WHILE BE DEAF
TILL I HAVE TOLD THIS SLANDER OF HIS BLOOD
HOW GOD AND GOOD MEN HATE SO FOUL A LIAR 
MOWBRAY IMPARTIAL ARE OUR EYES AND EARS
WERE HE MY BROTHER NAY MY KINGDOMS HEIR
AS HE IS BUT MY FATHERS BROTHERS SON
NOW BY MY SCEPTRES AWE I MAKE A VOW
SUCH NEIGHBOUR NEARNESS TO OUR SACRED BLOOD
SHOULD NOTHING PRIVILEGE HIM NOR PARTIALIZE
THE UNSTOOPING FIRMNESS OF MY UPRIGHT SOUL
HE IS OUR SUBJECT MOWBRAY SO ART THOU
FREE SPEECH AND FEARLESS I TO THEE ALLOW 
THEN BOLINGBROKE AS LOW AS TO THY HEART
THROUGH THE FALSE PASSAGE OF THY THROAT THOU LIEST 
THREE PARTS OF THAT RECEIPT I HAD FOR CALAIS
DISBURSED I DULY TO HIS HIGHNESS SOLDIERS
THE OTHER PART RESERVED I BY CONSENT
FOR THAT MY SOVEREIGN LIEGE WAS IN MY DEBT
UPON REMAINDER OF A DEAR ACCOUNT
SINCE LAST I WENT TO FRANCE TO FETCH HIS QUEEN
NOW SWALLOW DOWN THAT LIE  FOR GLOUCESTERS DEATH
I SLEW HIM NOT BUT TO MY OWN DISGRACE
NEGLECTED MY SWORN DUTY IN THAT CASE 
FOR YOU MY NOBLE LORD OF LANCASTER
THE HONOURABLE FATHER TO MY FOE
ONCE DID I LAY AN AMBUSH FOR YOUR LIFE
A TRESPASS THAT DOTH VEX MY GRIEVED SOUL
BUT ERE I LAST RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT
I DID CONFESS IT AND EXACTLY BEGGD
YOUR GRACES PARDON AND I HOPE I HAD IT 
THIS IS MY FAULT AS FOR THE REST APPEALLD
IT ISSUES FROM THE RANCOUR OF A VILLAIN
A RECREANT AND MOST DEGENERATE TRAITOR
WHICH IN MYSELF I BOLDLY WILL DEFEND
AND INTERCHANGEABLY HURL DOWN MY GAGE
UPON THIS OVERWEENING TRAITORS FOOT
TO PROVE MYSELF A LOYAL GENTLEMAN
EVEN IN THE BEST BLOOD CHAMBERD IN HIS BOSOM 
IN HASTE WHEREOF MOST HEARTILY I PRAY
YOUR HIGHNESS TO ASSIGN OUR TRIAL DAY 
WRATHKINDLED GENTLEMEN BE RULED BY ME
LETS PURGE THIS CHOLER WITHOUT LETTING BLOOD
THIS WE PRESCRIBE THOUGH NO PHYSICIAN
DEEP MALICE MAKES TOO DEEP INCISION
FORGET FORGIVE CONCLUDE AND BE AGREED
OUR DOCTORS SAY THIS IS NO MONTH TO BLEED 
GOOD UNCLE LET THIS END WHERE IT BEGUN
WELL CALM THE DUKE OF NORFOLK YOU YOUR SON 
TO BE A MAKEPEACE SHALL BECOME MY AGE
THROW DOWN MY SON THE DUKE OF NORFOLKS GAGE

WHEN HARRY WHEN
OBEDIENCE BIDS I SHOULD NOT BID AGAIN 
NORFOLK THROW DOWN WE BID THERE IS NO BOOT

DESPITE OF DEATH THAT LIVES UPON MY GRAVE
TO DARK DISHONOURS USE THOU SHALT NOT HAVE 
I AM DISGRACED IMPEACHD AND BAFFLED HERE
PIERCED TO THE SOUL WITH SLANDERS VENOMD SPEAR
THE WHICH NO BALM CAN CURE BUT HIS HEARTBLOOD

RAGE MUST BE WITHSTOOD
GIVE ME HIS GAGE LIONS MAKE LEOPARDS TAME 
YEA BUT NOT CHANGE HIS SPOTS TAKE BUT MY SHAME 
AND I RESIGN MY GAGE  MY DEAR DEAR LORD
THE PUREST TREASURE MORTAL TIMES AFFORD
IS SPOTLESS REPUTATION THAT AWAY
MEN ARE BUT GILDED LOAM OR PAINTED CLAY

OR SOUND SO BASE A PARLE MY TEETH SHALL TEAR

AND SPIT IT BLEEDING IN HIS HIGH DISGRACE
WHERE SHAME DOTH HARBOUR EVEN IN MOWBRAYS FACE 
WE WERE NOT BORN TO SUE BUT TO COMMAND
WHICH SINCE WE CANNOT DO TO MAKE YOU FRIENDS
BE READY AS YOUR LIVES SHALL ANSWER IT

FINDS BROTHERHOOD IN THEE NO SHARPER SPUR

THE SLY SLOW HOURS SHALL NOT DETERMINATE
THE DATELESS LIMIT OF THY DEAR EXILE
THE HOPELESS WORD OF NEVER TO RETURN
BREATHE I AGAINST THEE UPON PAIN OF LIFE 
A HEAVY SENTENCE MY MOST SOVEREIGN LIEGE
AND ALL UNLOOKD FOR FROM YOUR HIGHNESS MOUTH
A DEARER MERIT NOT SO DEEP A MAIM
AS TO BE CAST FORTH IN THE COMMON AIR
HAVE I DESERVED AT YOUR HIGHNESS HANDS 
THE LANGUAGE I HAVE LEARND THESE FORTY YEARS
MY NATIVE ENGLISH NOW I MUST FOREGO
AND NOW MY TONGUES USE IS TO ME NO MORE
THAN AN UNSTRINGED VIOL OR A HARP
OR LIKE A CUNNING INSTRUMENT CASED UP
OR BEING OPEN PUT INTO HIS HANDS
THAT KNOWS NO TOUCH TO TUNE THE HARMONY
WITHIN MY MOUTH YOU HAVE ENGAOLD MY TONGUE
DOUBLY PORTCULLISD WITH MY TEETH AND LIPS
AND DULL UNFEELING BARREN IGNORANCE
IS MADE MY GAOLER TO ATTEND ON ME 
I AM TOO OLD TO FAWN UPON A NURSE
TOO FAR IN YEARS TO BE A PUPIL NOW
WHAT IS THY SENTENCE THEN BUT SPEECHLESS DEATH
WHICH ROBS MY TONGUE FROM BREATHING NATIVE BREATH
IT BOOTS THEE NOT TO BE COMPASSIONATE
AFTER OUR SENTENCE PLAINING COMES TOO LATE 
THEN THUS I TURN ME FROM MY COUNTRYS LIGHT
TO DWELL IN SOLEMN SHADES OF ENDLESS NIGHT 
RETURN AGAIN AND TAKE AN OATH WITH THEE 
LAY ON OUR ROYAL SWORD YOUR BANISHD HANDS
SWEAR BY THE DUTY THAT YOU OWE TO GOD 
OUR PART THEREIN WE BANISH WITH YOURSELVES 
TO KEEP THE OATH THAT WE ADMINISTER
YOU NEVER SHALL SO HELP YOU TRUTH AND GOD 
EMBRACE EACH OTHERS LOVE IN BANISHMENT
NOR NEVER LOOK UPON EACH OTHERS FACE
NOR NEVER WRITE REGREET NOR RECONCILE
THIS LOURING TEMPEST OF YOUR HOMEBRED HATE
NOR NEVER BY ADVISED PURPOSE MEET
TO PLOT CONTRIVE OR COMPLOT ANY ILL
GAINST US OUR STATE OUR SUBJECTS OR OUR LAND 
I SWEAR 
AND I TO KEEP ALL THIS 
NORFOLK SO FAR AS TO MINE ENEMY 
BY THIS TIME HAD THE KING PERMITTED US
ONE OF OUR SOULS HAD WANDERD IN THE AIR 
BANISHD THIS FRAIL SEPULCHRE OF OUR FLESH
AS NOW OUR FLESH IS BANISHD FROM THIS LAND
CONFESS THY TREASONS ERE THOU FLY THE REALM
SINCE THOU HAST FAR TO GO BEAR NOT ALONG
THE CLOGGING BURTHEN OF A GUILTY SOUL 
NO BOLINGBROKE IF EVER I WERE TRAITOR
MY NAME BE BLOTTED FROM THE BOOK OF LIFE
AND I FROM HEAVEN BANISHD AS FROM HENCE 
BUT WHAT THOU ART GOD THOU AND I DO KNOW
AND ALL TOO SOON I FEAR THE KING SHALL RUE 
FAREWELL MY LIEGE  NOW NO WAY CAN I STRAY
SAVE BACK TO ENGLAND ALL THE WORLDS MY WAY 
UNCLE EVEN IN THE GLASSES OF THINE EYES
I SEE THY GRIEVED HEART THY SAD ASPECT
HATH FROM THE NUMBER OF HIS BANISHD YEARS
PLUCKD FOUR AWAY 
SIX FROZEN WINTER SPENT
RETURN WITH WELCOME HOME FROM BANISHMENT 
HOW LONG A TIME LIES IN ONE LITTLE WORD 
FOUR LAGGING WINTERS AND FOUR WANTON SPRINGS
END IN A WORD SUCH IS THE BREATH OF KINGS 
I THANK MY LIEGE THAT IN REGARD OF ME
HE SHORTENS FOUR YEARS OF MY SONS EXILE
BUT LITTLE VANTAGE SHALL I REAP THEREBY
FOR ERE THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HATH TO SPEND
CAN CHANGE THEIR MOONS AND BRING THEIR TIMES ABOUT
MY OILDRIED LAMP AND TIMEBEWASTED LIGHT
SHALL BE EXTINCT WITH AGE AND ENDLESS NIGHT
MY INCH OF TAPER WILL BE BURNT AND DONE
AND BLINDFOLD DEATH NOT LET ME SEE MY SON 
WHY UNCLE THOU HAST MANY YEARS TO LIVE 
BUT NOT A MINUTE KING THAT THOU CANST GIVE
SHORTEN MY DAYS THOU CANST WITH SULLEN SORROW
AND PLUCK NIGHTS FROM ME BUT NOT LEND A MORROW
THOU CANST HELP TIME TO FURROW ME WITH AGE
BUT STOP NO WRINKLE IN HIS PILGRIMAGE
THY WORD IS CURRENT WITH HIM FOR MY DEATH
BUT DEAD THY KINGDOM CANNOT BUY MY BREATH 
THY SON IS BANISHD UPON GOOD ADVICE
WHERETO THY TONGUE A PARTYVERDICT GAVE
WHY AT OUR JUSTICE SEEMST THOU THEN TO LOUR
THINGS SWEET TO TASTE PROVE IN DIGESTION SOUR 
YOU URGED ME AS A JUDGE BUT I HAD RATHER
YOU WOULD HAVE BID ME ARGUE LIKE A FATHER 
O HAD IT BEEN A STRANGER NOT MY CHILD
TO SMOOTH HIS FAULT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MILD
A PARTIAL SLANDER SOUGHT I TO AVOID
AND IN THE SENTENCE MY OWN LIFE DESTROYD 
ALAS I LOOKD WHEN SOME OF YOU SHOULD SAY
I WAS TOO STRICT TO MAKE MINE OWN AWAY
BUT YOU GAVE LEAVE TO MY UNWILLING TONGUE
AGAINST MY WILL TO DO MYSELF THIS WRONG 
COUSIN FAREWELL AND UNCLE BID HIM SO
SIX YEARS WE BANISH HIM AND HE SHALL GO 
COUSIN FAREWELL WHAT PRESENCE MUST NOT KNOW
FROM WHERE YOU DO REMAIN LET PAPER SHOW 
MY LORD NO LEAVE TAKE I FOR I WILL RIDE
AS FAR AS LAND WILL LET ME BY YOUR SIDE 
O TO WHAT PURPOSE DOST THOU HOARD THY WORDS
THAT THOU RETURNST NO GREETING TO THY FRIENDS
I HAVE TOO FEW TO TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU
WHEN THE TONGUES OFFICE SHOULD BE PRODIGAL
TO BREATHE THE ABUNDANT DOLOUR OF THE HEART 
THY GRIEF IS BUT THY ABSENCE FOR A TIME 
JOY ABSENT GRIEF IS PRESENT FOR THAT TIME 
WHAT IS SIX WINTERS THEY ARE QUICKLY GONE 
TO MEN IN JOY BUT GRIEF MAKES ONE HOUR TEN 
CALL IT A TRAVEL THAT THOU TAKEST FOR PLEASURE 
MY HEART WILL SIGH WHEN I MISCALL IT SO
WHICH FINDS IT AN INFORCED PILGRIMAGE 
THE SULLEN PASSAGE OF THY WEARY STEPS
ESTEEM AS FOIL WHEREIN THOU ART TO SET
THE PRECIOUS JEWEL OF THY HOME RETURN 
NAY RATHER EVERY TEDIOUS STRIDE I MAKE
WILL BUT REMEMBER ME WHAT A DEAL OF WORLD
I WANDER FROM THE JEWELS THAT I LOVE 
MUST I NOT SERVE A LONG APPRENTICEHOOD
TO FOREIGN PASSAGES AND IN THE END
HAVING MY FREEDOM BOAST OF NOTHING ELSE
BUT THAT I WAS A JOURNEYMAN TO GRIEF
ALL PLACES THAT THE EYE OF HEAVEN VISITS
ARE TO A WISE MAN PORTS AND HAPPY HAVENS 
TEACH THY NECESSITY TO REASON THUS
THERE IS NO VIRTUE LIKE NECESSITY 
THINK NOT THE KING DID BANISH THEE
BUT THOU THE KING  WOE DOTH THE HEAVIER SIT
WHERE IT PERCEIVES IT IS BUT FAINTLY BORNE 
GO SAY I SENT THEE FORTH TO PURCHASE HONOUR
AND NOT THE KING EXILED THEE OR SUPPOSE
DEVOURING PESTILENCE HANGS IN OUR AIR
AND THOU ART FLYING TO A FRESHER CLIME
LOOK WHAT THY SOUL HOLDS DEAR IMAGINE IT
TO LIE THAT WAY THOU GOST NOT WHENCE THOU COMEST
SUPPOSE THE SINGING BIRDS MUSICIANS
THE GRASS WHEREON THOU TREADST THE PRESENCE STREWD
THE FLOWERS FAIR LADIES AND THY STEPS NO MORE
THAN A DELIGHTFUL MEASURE OR A DANCE
FOR GNARLING SORROW HATH LESS POWER TO BITE
THE MAN THAT MOCKS AT IT AND SETS IT LIGHT 
O WHO CAN HOLD A FIRE IN HIS HAND
BY THINKING ON THE FROSTY CAUCASUS
OR CLOY THE HUNGRY EDGE OF APPETITE
BY BARE IMAGINATION OF A FEAST
OR WALLOW NAKED IN DECEMBER SNOW
BY THINKING ON FANTASTIC SUMMERS HEAT
O NO  THE APPREHENSION OF THE GOOD
GIVES BUT THE GREATER FEELING TO THE WORSE
FELL SORROWS TOOTH DOTH NEVER RANKLE MORE
THAN WHEN HE BITES BUT LANCETH NOT THE SORE 
COME COME MY SON ILL BRING THEE ON THY WAY
HAD I THY YOUTH AND CAUSE I WOULD NOT STAY 
THEN ENGLANDS GROUND FAREWELL SWEET SOIL ADIEU
MY MOTHER AND MY NURSE THAT BEARS ME YET 
WHEREER I WANDER BOAST OF THIS I CAN
THOUGH BANISHD YET A TRUEBORN ENGLISHMAN 
WE DID OBSERVE  COUSIN AUMERLE
HOW FAR BROUGHT YOU HIGH HEREFORD ON HIS WAY
I BROUGHT HIGH HEREFORD IF YOU CALL HIM SO
BUT TO THE NEXT HIGHWAY AND THERE I LEFT HIM 
AND SAY WHAT STORE OF PARTING TEARS WERE SHED
FAITH NONE FOR ME EXCEPT THE NORTHEAST WIND
WHICH THEN BLEW BITTERLY AGAINST OUR FACES
AWAKED THE SLEEPING RHEUM AND SO BY CHANCE
DID GRACE OUR HOLLOW PARTING WITH A TEAR 
WHAT SAID OUR COUSIN WHEN YOU PARTED WITH HIM
FAREWELL
AND FOR MY HEART DISDAINED THAT MY TONGUE
SHOULD SO PROFANE THE WORD THAT TAUGHT ME CRAFT
TO COUNTERFEIT OPPRESSION OF SUCH GRIEF
THAT WORDS SEEMD BURIED IN MY SORROWS GRAVE 
MARRY WOULD THE WORD FAREWELL HAVE LENGTHEND HOURS
AND ADDED YEARS TO HIS SHORT BANISHMENT
HE SHOULD HAVE HAD A VOLUME OF FAREWELLS
BUT SINCE IT WOULD NOT HE HAD NONE OF ME 
HE IS OUR COUSIN COUSIN BUT TIS DOUBT
WHEN TIME SHALL CALL HIM HOME FROM BANISHMENT
WHETHER OUR KINSMAN COME TO SEE HIS FRIENDS 
OURSELF AND BUSHY BAGOT HERE AND GREEN
OBSERVED HIS COURTSHIP TO THE COMMON PEOPLE
HOW HE DID SEEM TO DIVE INTO THEIR HEARTS
WITH HUMBLE AND FAMILIAR COURTESY
WHAT REVERENCE HE DID THROW AWAY ON SLAVES
WOOING POOR CRAFTSMEN WITH THE CRAFT OF SMILES
AND PATIENT UNDERBEARING OF HIS FORTUNE
AS TWERE TO BANISH THEIR AFFECTS WITH HIM 
OFF GOES HIS BONNET TO AN OYSTERWENCH
A BRACE OF DRAYMEN BID GOD SPEED HIM WELL
AND HAD THE TRIBUTE OF HIS SUPPLE KNEE
WITH THANKS MY COUNTRYMEN MY LOVING FRIENDS
AS WERE OUR ENGLAND IN REVERSION HIS
AND HE OUR SUBJECTS NEXT DEGREE IN HOPE 
WELL HE IS GONE AND WITH HIM GO THESE THOUGHTS 
NOW FOR THE REBELS WHICH STAND OUT IN IRELAND
EXPEDIENT MANAGE MUST BE MADE MY LIEGE
ERE FURTHER LEISURE YIELD THEM FURTHER MEANS
FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE AND YOUR HIGHNESS LOSS 
WE WILL OURSELF IN PERSON TO THIS WAR
AND FOR OUR COFFERS WITH TOO GREAT A COURT
AND LIBERAL LARGESS ARE GROWN SOMEWHAT LIGHT
WE ARE INFORCED TO FARM OUR ROYAL REALM
THE REVENUE WHEREOF SHALL FURNISH US
FOR OUR AFFAIRS IN HAND IF THAT COME SHORT
OUR SUBSTITUTES AT HOME SHALL HAVE BLANK CHARTERS
WHERETO WHEN THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT MEN ARE RICH
THEY SHALL SUBSCRIBE THEM FOR LARGE SUMS OF GOLD
AND SEND THEM AFTER TO SUPPLY OUR WANTS
FOR WE WILL MAKE FOR IRELAND PRESENTLY 
BUSHY WHAT NEWS
OLD JOHN OF GAUNT IS GRIEVOUS SICK MY LORD
SUDDENLY TAKEN AND HATH SENT POST HASTE
TO ENTREAT YOUR MAJESTY TO VISIT HIM 
WHERE LIES HE

NOW PUT IT GOD IN THE PHYSICIANS MIND
TO HELP HIM TO HIS GRAVE IMMEDIATELY 
THE LINING OF HIS COFFERS SHALL MAKE COATS
TO DECK OUR SOLDIERS FOR THESE IRISH WARS 
COME GENTLEMEN LETS ALL GO VISIT HIM
PRAY GOD WE MAY MAKE HASTE AND COME TOO LATE 
AMEN 
WILL THE KING COME THAT I MAY BREATHE MY LAST
IN WHOLESOME COUNSEL TO HIS UNSTAID YOUTH
VEX NOT YOURSELF NOR STRIVE NOT WITH YOUR BREATH
FOR ALL IN VAIN COMES COUNSEL TO HIS EAR 
O BUT THEY SAY THE TONGUES OF DYING MEN
ENFORCE ATTENTION LIKE DEEP HARMONY
WHERE WORDS ARE SCARCE THEY ARE SELDOM SPENT IN VAIN
FOR THEY BREATHE TRUTH THAT BREATHE THEIR WORDS IN PAIN 
HE THAT NO MORE MUST SAY IS LISTEND MORE
THAN THEY WHOM YOUTH AND EASE HAVE TAUGHT TO GLOSE
MORE ARE MENS ENDS MARKD THAN THEIR LIVES BEFORE
THE SETTING SUN AND MUSIC AT THE CLOSE
AS THE LAST TASTE OF SWEETS IS SWEETEST LAST
WRIT IN REMEMBRANCE MORE THAN THINGS LONG PAST
THOUGH RICHARD MY LIFES COUNSEL WOULD NOT HEAR
MY DEATHS SAD TALE MAY YET UNDEAF HIS EAR 
NO IT IS STOPPD WITH OTHER FLATTERING SOUNDS
AS PRAISES OF WHOSE TASTE THE WISE ARE FOND
LASCIVIOUS METRES TO WHOSE VENOM SOUND
THE OPEN EAR OF YOUTH DOTH ALWAYS LISTEN
REPORT OF FASHIONS IN PROUD ITALY
WHOSE MANNERS STILL OUR TARDY APISH NATION
LIMPS AFTER IN BASE IMITATION 
WHERE DOTH THE WORLD THRUST FORTH A VANITY 
SO IT BE NEW THERES NO RESPECT HOW VILE 
THAT IS NOT QUICKLY BUZZED INTO HIS EARS
THEN ALL TOO LATE COMES COUNSEL TO BE HEARD
WHERE WILL DOTH MUTINY WITH WITS REGARD 
DIRECT NOT HIM WHOSE WAY HIMSELF WILL CHOOSE
TIS BREATH THOU LACKST AND THAT BREATH WILT THOU LOSE 
METHINKS I AM A PROPHET NEW INSPIRED
AND THUS EXPIRING DO FORETELL OF HIM
HIS RASH FIERCE BLAZE OF RIOT CANNOT LAST
FOR VIOLENT FIRES SOON BURN OUT THEMSELVES
SMALL SHOWERS LAST LONG BUT SUDDEN STORMS ARE SHORT
HE TIRES BETIMES THAT SPURS TOO FAST BETIMES
WITH EAGER FEEDING FOOD DOTH CHOKE THE FEEDER
LIGHT VANITY INSATIATE CORMORANT
CONSUMING MEANS SOON PREYS UPON ITSELF 
THIS ROYAL THRONE OF KINGS THIS SCEPTERD ISLE
THIS EARTH OF MAJESTY THIS SEAT OF MARS
THIS OTHER EDEN DEMIPARADISE
THIS FORTRESS BUILT BY NATURE FOR HERSELF
AGAINST INFECTION AND THE HAND OF WAR
THIS HAPPY BREED OF MEN THIS LITTLE WORLD
THIS PRECIOUS STONE SET IN THE SILVER SEA
WHICH SERVES IT IN THE OFFICE OF A WALL
OR AS A MOAT DEFENSIVE TO A HOUSE
AGAINST THE ENVY OF LESS HAPPIER LANDS
THIS BLESSED PLOT THIS EARTH THIS REALM THIS ENGLAND
THIS NURSE THIS TEEMING WOMB OF ROYAL KINGS
FEARD BY THEIR BREED AND FAMOUS BY THEIR BIRTH
RENOWNED FOR THEIR DEEDS AS FAR FROM HOME
FOR CHRISTIAN SERVICE AND TRUE CHIVALRY
AS IS THE SEPULCHRE IN STUBBORN JEWRY
OF THE WORLDS RANSOM BLESSED MARYS SON
THIS LAND OF SUCH DEAR SOULS THIS DEAR DEAR LAND
DEAR FOR HER REPUTATION THROUGH THE WORLD
IS NOW LEASED OUT I DIE PRONOUNCING IT
LIKE TO A TENEMENT OR PELTING FARM
ENGLAND BOUND IN WITH THE TRIUMPHANT SEA
WHOSE ROCKY SHORE BEATS BACK THE ENVIOUS SIEGE
OF WATERY NEPTUNE IS NOW BOUND IN WITH SHAME
WITH INKY BLOTS AND ROTTEN PARCHMENT BONDS
THAT ENGLAND THAT WAS WONT TO CONQUER OTHERS
HATH MADE A SHAMEFUL CONQUEST OF ITSELF 
AH WOULD THE SCANDAL VANISH WITH MY LIFE

OLD GAUNT INDEED AND GAUNT IN BEING OLD
WITHIN ME GRIEF HATH KEPT A TEDIOUS FAST
AND WHO ABSTAINS FROM MEAT THAT IS NOT GAUNT

THE PLEASURE THAT SOME FATHERS FEED UPON
IS MY STRICT FAST I MEAN MY CHILDRENS LOOKS
AND THEREIN FASTING HAST THOU MADE ME GAUNT
GAUNT AM I FOR THE GRAVE GAUNT AS A GRAVE
WHOSE HOLLOW WOMB INHERITS NOUGHT BUT BONES 
CAN SICK MEN PLAY SO NICELY WITH THEIR NAMES
NO MISERY MAKES SPORT TO MOCK ITSELF

WHICH I PROTEST HATH VERY MUCH BEGUILED
THE TEDIOUSNESS AND PROCESS OF MY TRAVEL
BUT THEIRS IS SWEETENED WITH THE HOPE TO HAVE
THE PRESENT BENEFIT WHICH I POSSESS
AND HOPE TO JOY IS LITTLE LESS IN JOY

SHALL MAKE THEIR WAY SEEM SHORT AS MINE HATH DONE
BY SIGHT OF WHAT I HAVE YOUR NOBLE COMPANY 
OF MUCH LESS VALUE IS MY COMPANY
THAN YOUR GOOD WORDS  BUT WHO COMES HERE

HE WAS NOT SO RESOLVED WHEN LAST WE SPAKE TOGETHER 
BECAUSE YOUR LORDSHIP WAS PROCLAIMED TRAITOR 
BUT HE MY LORD IS GONE TO RAVENSPURGH
TO OFFER SERVICE TO THE DUKE OF HEREFORD
AND SENT ME OVER BY BERKELEY TO DISCOVER
WHAT POWER THE DUKE OF YORK HAD LEVIED THERE
THEN WITH DIRECTIONS TO REPAIR TO RAVENSPURGH

MY GRACIOUS UNCLE

I AM NO TRAITORS UNCLE AND THAT WORD GRACE 
IN AN UNGRACIOUS MOUTH IS BUT PROFANE 
WHY HAVE THOSE BANISHD AND FORBIDDEN LEGS
DARED ONCE TO TOUCH A DUST OF ENGLANDS GROUND
BUT THEN MORE WHY WHY HAVE THEY DARED TO MARCH
SO MANY MILES UPON HER PEACEFUL BOSOM
FRIGHTING HER PALEFACED VILLAGES WITH WAR
AND OSTENTATION OF DESPISED ARMS
COMEST THOU BECAUSE THE ANOINTED KING IS HENCE
WHY FOOLISH BOY THE KING IS LEFT BEHIND
AND IN MY LOYAL BOSOM LIES HIS POWER 
WERE I BUT NOW THE LORD OF SUCH HOT YOUTH
AS WHEN BRAVE GAUNT THY FATHER AND MYSELF
RESCUED THE BLACK PRINCE THAT YOUNG MARS OF MEN
FROM FORTH THE RANKS OF MANY THOUSAND FRENCH
O THEN HOW QUICKLY SHOULD THIS ARM OF MINE 
NOW PRISONER TO THE PALSY CHASTISE THEE
AND MINISTER CORRECTION TO THY FAULT 
MY GRACIOUS UNCLE LET ME KNOW MY FAULT

AND THESE AND ALL ARE ALL AMISS EMPLOYD 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO I AM A SUBJECT
AND I CHALLENGE LAW ATTORNEYS ARE DENIED ME
AND THEREFORE PERSONALLY I LAY MY CLAIM
TO MY INHERITANCE OF FREE DESCENT 
THE NOBLE DUKE HATH BEEN TOO MUCH ABUSED 
IT STANDS YOUR GRACE UPON TO DO HIM RIGHT 
BASE MEN BY HIS ENDOWMENTS ARE MADE GREAT 
MY LORDS OF ENGLAND LET ME TELL YOU THIS
I HAVE HAD FEELING OF MY COUSINS WRONGS
AND LABOURED ALL I COULD TO DO HIM RIGHT
BUT IN THIS KIND TO COME IN BRAVING ARMS
BE HIS OWN CARVER AND CUT OUT HIS WAY
TO FIND OUT RIGHT WITH WRONG IT MAY NOT BE
AND YOU THAT DO ABET HIM IN THIS KIND
CHERISH REBELLION AND ARE REBELS ALL 
THE NOBLE DUKE HATH SWORN HIS COMING IS

WE ALL HAVE STRONGLY SWORN TO GIVE HIM AID
AND LET HIM NEER SEE JOY THAT BREAKS THAT OATH 
WELL WELL I SEE THE ISSUE OF THESE ARMS
I CANNOT MEND IT I MUST NEEDS CONFESS
BECAUSE MY POWER IS WEAK AND ALL ILL LEFT
BUT IF I COULD BY HIM THAT GAVE ME LIFE
I WOULD ATTACH YOU ALL AND MAKE YOU STOOP
UNTO THE SOVEREIGN MERCY OF THE KING
BUT SINCE I CANNOT BE IT KNOWN TO YOU
I DO REMAIN AS NEUTER  SO FARE YOU WELL
UNLESS YOU PLEASE TO ENTER IN THE CASTLE
AND THERE REPOSE YOU FOR THIS NIGHT 
AN OFFER UNCLE THAT WE WILL ACCEPT
BUT WE MUST WIN YOUR GRACE TO GO WITH US
TO BRISTOL CASTLE WHICH THEY SAY IS HELD
BY BUSHY BAGOT AND THEIR COMPLICES
THE CATERPILLARS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
WHICH I HAVE SWORN TO WEED AND PLUCK AWAY 
IT MAY BE I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT YET ILL PAUSE
FOR I AM LOATH TO BREAK OUR COUNTRYS LAWS 
NOR FRIENDS NOR FOES TO ME WELCOME YOU ARE
THINGS PAST REDRESS ARE NOW WITH ME PAST CARE 
MY LORD OF SALISBURY WE HAVE STAYD TEN DAYS
AND HARDLY KEPT OUR COUNTRYMEN TOGETHER
AND YET WE HEAR NO TIDINGS FROM THE KING
THEREFORE WE WILL DISPERSE OURSELVES FAREWELL 
STAY YET ANOTHER DAY THOU TRUSTY WELSHMAN
THE KING REPOSETH ALL HIS CONFIDENCE IN THEE 
TIS THOUGHT THE KING IS DEAD WE WILL NOT STAY 
THE BAYTREES IN OUR COUNTRY ARE ALL WITHERD
AND METEORS FRIGHT THE FIXED STARS OF HEAVEN
THE PALEFACED MOON LOOKS BLOODY ON THE EARTH
AND LEANLOOKD PROPHETS WHISPER FEARFUL CHANGE
RICH MEN LOOK SAD AND RUFFIANS DANCE AND LEAP
THE ONE IN FEAR TO LOSE WHAT THEY ENJOY
THE OTHER TO ENJOY BY RAGE AND WAR
THESE SIGNS FORERUN THE DEATH OR FALL OF KINGS 
FAREWELL OUR COUNTRYMEN ARE GONE AND FLED
AS WELL ASSURED RICHARD THEIR KING IS DEAD 
AH RICHARD WITH THE EYES OF HEAVY MIND
I SEE THY GLORY LIKE A SHOOTING STAR
FALL TO THE BASE EARTH FROM THE FIRMAMENT 
THY SUN SETS WEEPING IN THE LOWLY WEST
WITNESSING STORMS TO COME WOE AND UNREST
THY FRIENDS ARE FLED TO WAIT UPON THY FOES
AND CROSSLY TO THY GOOD ALL FORTUNE GOES 
BRING FORTH THESE MEN 
BUSHY AND GREEN I WILL NOT VEX YOUR SOULS 
SINCE PRESENTLY YOUR SOULS MUST PART YOUR BODIES 
WITH TOO MUCH URGING YOUR PERNICIOUS LIVES
FOR TWERE NO CHARITY YET TO WASH YOUR BLOOD
FROM OFF MY HANDS HERE IN THE VIEW OF MEN
I WILL UNFOLD SOME CAUSES OF YOUR DEATHS 
YOU HAVE MISLED A PRINCE A ROYAL KING
A HAPPY GENTLEMAN IN BLOOD AND LINEAMENTS
BY YOU UNHAPPIED AND DISFIGURED CLEAN
YOU HAVE IN MANNER WITH YOUR SINFUL HOURS
MADE A DIVORCE BETWIXT HIS QUEEN AND HIM
BROKE THE POSSESSION OF A ROYAL BED
AND STAIND THE BEAUTY OF A FAIR QUEENS CHEEKS
WITH TEARS DRAWN FROM HER EYES BY YOUR FOUL WRONGS 
MYSELF A PRINCE BY FORTUNE OF MY BIRTH
NEAR TO THE KING IN BLOOD AND NEAR IN LOVE
TILL YOU DID MAKE HIM MISINTERPRET ME
HAVE STOOPD MY NECK UNDER YOUR INJURIES
AND SIGHD MY ENGLISH BREATH IN FOREIGN CLOUDS
EATING THE BITTER BREAD OF BANISHMENT
WHILST YOU HAVE FED UPON MY SIGNORIES
DISPARKD MY PARKS AND FELLD MY FOREST WOODS
FROM MY OWN WINDOWS TORN MY HOUSEHOLD COAT
RAZED OUT MY IMPRESE LEAVING ME NO SIGN
SAVE MENS OPINIONS AND MY LIVING BLOOD
TO SHOW THE WORLD I AM A GENTLEMAN 
THIS AND MUCH MORE MUCH MORE THAN TWICE ALL THIS
CONDEMNS YOU TO THE DEATH  SEE THEM DELIVERD OVER
TO EXECUTION AND THE HAND OF DEATH 
MORE WELCOME IS THE STROKE OF DEATH TO ME
THAN BOLINGBROKE TO ENGLAND  LORDS FAREWELL 
MY COMFORT IS THAT HEAVEN WILL TAKE OUR SOULS
AND PLAGUE INJUSTICE WITH THE PAINS OF HELL 
MY LORD NORTHUMBERLAND SEE THEM DISPATCHD 
UNCLE YOU SAY THE QUEEN IS AT YOUR HOUSE
FOR GODS SAKE FAIRLY LET HER BE ENTREATED
TELL HER I SEND TO HER MY KIND COMMENDS
TAKE SPECIAL CARE MY GREETINGS BE DELIVERD 
A GENTLEMAN OF MINE I HAVE DISPATCHD
WITH LETTERS OF YOUR LOVE TO HER AT LARGE 
THANK GENTLE UNCLE  COME LORDS AWAY 
TO FIGHT WITH GLENDOWER AND HIS COMPLICES
AWHILE TO WORK AND AFTER HOLIDAY 
BARKLOUGHLY CASTLE CALL THEY THIS AT HAND
YEA MY LORD  HOW BROOKS YOUR GRACE THE AIR
AFTER YOUR LATE TOSSING ON THE BREAKING SEAS
NEEDS MUST I LIKE IT WELL I WEEP FOR JOY
TO STAND UPON MY KINGDOM ONCE AGAIN 
DEAR EARTH I DO SALUTE THEE WITH MY HAND
THOUGH REBELS WOUND THEE WITH THEIR HORSES HOOFS
AS A LONGPARTED MOTHER WITH HER CHILD
PLAYS FONDLY WITH HER TEARS AND SMILES IN MEETING
SO WEEPING SMILING GREET I THEE MY EARTH
AND DO THEE FAVOURS WITH MY ROYAL HANDS 
FEED NOT THY SOVEREIGNS FOE MY GENTLE EARTH
NOR WITH THY SWEETS COMFORT HIS RAVENOUS SENSE
BUT LET THY SPIDERS THAT SUCK UP THY VENOM
AND HEAVYGAITED TOADS LIE IN THEIR WAY
DOING ANNOYANCE TO THE TREACHEROUS FEET
WHICH WITH USURPING STEPS DO TRAMPLE THEE
YIELD STINGING NETTLES TO MINE ENEMIES
AND WHEN THEY FROM THY BOSOM PLUCK A FLOWER
GUARD IT I PRAY THEE WITH A LURKING ADDER
WHOSE DOUBLE TONGUE MAY WITH A MORTAL TOUCH
THROW DEATH UPON THY SOVEREIGNS ENEMIES 
MOCK NOT MY SENSELESS CONJURATION LORDS
THIS EARTH SHALL HAVE A FEELING AND THESE STONES
PROVE ARMED SOLDIERS ERE HER NATIVE KING
SHALL FALTER UNDER FOUL REBELLIONS ARMS 
FEAR NOT MY LORD THAT POWER THAT MADE YOU KING
HATH POWER TO KEEP YOU KING IN SPITE OF ALL 
THE MEANS THAT HEAVEN YIELDS MUST BE EMBRACED
AND NOT NEGLECTED ELSE IF HEAVEN WOULD
AND WE WILL NOT HEAVENS OFFER WE REFUSE
THE PROFFERD MEANS OF SUCCOR AND REDRESS 
HE MEANS MY LORD THAT WE ARE TOO REMISS
WHILST BOLINGBROKE THROUGH OUR SECURITY
GROWS STRONG AND GREAT IN SUBSTANCE AND IN POWER 
DISCOMFORTABLE COUSIN  KNOWST THOU NOT
THAT WHEN THE SEARCHING EYE OF HEAVEN IS HID
BEHIND THE GLOBE THAT LIGHTS THE LOWER WORLD
THEN THIEVES AND ROBBERS RANGE ABROAD UNSEEN
IN MURDERS AND IN OUTRAGE BOLDLY HERE
BUT WHEN FROM UNDER THIS TERRESTRIAL BALL
HE FIRES THE PROUD TOPS OF THE EASTERN PINES
AND DARTS HIS LIGHT THROUGH EVERY GUILTY HOLE
THEN MURDERS TREASONS AND DETESTED SINS
THE CLOAK OF NIGHT BEING PLUCKD FROM OFF THEIR BACKS
STAND BARE AND NAKED TREMBLING AT THEMSELVES
SO WHEN THIS THIEF THIS TRAITOR BOLINGBROKE
WHO ALL THIS WHILE HATH REVELLD IN THE NIGHT
WHILST WE WERE WANDERING WITH THE ANTIPODES
SHALL SEE US RISING IN OUR THRONE THE EAST
HIS TREASONS WILL SIT BLUSHING IN HIS FACE
NOT ABLE TO ENDURE THE SIGHT OF DAY
BUT SELFAFFRIGHTED TREMBLE AT HIS SIN 
NOT ALL THE WATER IN THE ROUGH RUDE SEA
CAN WASH THE BALM OFF FROM AN ANOINTED KING
THE BREATH OF WORLDLY MEN CANNOT DEPOSE
THE DEPUTY ELECTED BY THE LORD
FOR EVERY MAN THAT BOLINGBROKE HATH PRESSD
TO LIFT SHREWD STEEL AGAINST OUR GOLDEN CROWN
GOD FOR HIS RICHARD HATH IN HEAVENLY PAY
A GLORIOUS ANGEL THEN IF ANGELS FIGHT
WEAK MEN MUST FALL FOR HEAVEN STILL GUARDS THE RIGHT 
WELCOME MY LORD HOW FAR OFF LIES YOUR POWER
NOR NEAR NOR FARTHER OFF MY GRACIOUS LORD
THAN THIS WEAK ARM DISCOMFORT GUIDES MY TONGUE
AND BIDS ME SPEAK OF NOTHING BUT DESPAIR 
ONE DAY TOO LATE I FEAR ME NOBLE LORD
HATH CLOUDED ALL THY HAPPY DAYS ON EARTH
O CALL BACK YESTERDAY BID TIME RETURN
AND THOU SHALT HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN 
TODAY TODAY UNHAPPY DAY TOO LATE
OERTHROWS THY JOYS FRIENDS FORTUNE AND THY STATE
FOR ALL THE WELSHMEN HEARING THOU WERT DEAD 
ARE GONE TO BOLINGBROKE DISPERSED AND FLED 
COMFORT MY LIEGE WHY LOOKS YOUR GRACE SO PALE
BUT NOW THE BLOOD OF TWENTY THOUSAND MEN
DID TRIUMPH IN MY FACE AND THEY ARE FLED
AND TILL SO MUCH BLOOD THITHER COME AGAIN
HAVE I NOT REASON TO LOOK PALE AND DEAD
ALL SOULS THAT WILL BE SAFE FLY FROM MY SIDE
FOR TIME HATH SET A BLOT UPON MY PRIDE 
COMFORT MY LIEGE REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE 
I HAD FORGOT MYSELF AM I NOT KING
AWAKE THOU COWARD MAJESTY  THOU SLEEPEST 
IS NOT THE KINGS NAME TWENTY THOUSAND NAMES
ARM ARM MY NAME  A PUNY SUBJECT STRIKES
AT THY GREAT GLORY  LOOK NOT TO THE GROUND
YE FAVOURITES OF A KING ARE WE NOT HIGH
HIGH BE OUR THOUGHTS I KNOW MY UNCLE YORK
HATH POWER ENOUGH TO SERVE OUR TURN  BUT WHO COMES HERE
MORE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS BETIDE MY LIEGE
THAN CAN MY CARETUNED TONGUE DELIVER HIM 
MINE EAR IS OPEN AND MY HEART PREPARED
THE WORST IS WORLDLY LOSS THOU CANST UNFOLD 
SAY IS MY KINGDOM LOST WHY TWAS MY CARE
AND WHAT LOSS IS IT TO BE RID OF CARE
STRIVES BOLINGBROKE TO BE AS GREAT AS WE
GREATER HE SHALL NOT BE IF HE SERVE GOD
WELL SERVE HIM TOO AND BE HIS FELLOW SO
REVOLT OUR SUBJECTS THAT WE CANNOT MEND
THEY BREAK THEIR FAITH TO GOD AS WELL AS US
CRY WOE DESTRUCTION RUIN AND DECAY
THE WORST IS DEATH AND DEATH WILL HAVE HIS DAY 
GLAD AM I THAT YOUR HIGHNESS IS SO ARMD
TO BEAR THE TIDINGS OF CALAMITY 
LIKE AN UNSEASONABLE STORMY DAY
WHICH MAKES THE SILVER RIVERS DROWN THEIR SHORES
AS IF THE WORLD WERE ALL DISSOLVED TO TEARS
SO HIGH ABOVE HIS LIMITS SWELLS THE RAGE
OF BOLINGBROKE COVERING YOUR FEARFUL LAND
WITH HARD BRIGHT STEEL AND HEARTS HARDER THAN STEEL 
WHITEBEARDS HAVE ARMD THEIR THIN AND HAIRLESS SCALPS
AGAINST THY MAJESTY BOYS WITH WOMENS VOICES
STRIVE TO SPEAK BIG AND CLAP THEIR FEMALE JOINTS
IN STIFF UNWIELDY ARMS AGAINST THY CROWN
THE VERY BEADSMEN LEARN TO BEND THEIR BOWS
OF DOUBLEFATAL YEW AGAINST THY STATE
YEA DISTAFFWOMEN MANAGE RUSTY BILLS
AGAINST THY SEAT BOTH YOUNG AND OLD REBEL
AND ALL GOES WORSE THAN I HAVE POWER TO TELL 
TOO WELL TOO WELL THOU TELLST A TALE SO ILL 
WHERE IS THE EARL OF WILTSHIRE WHERE IS BAGOT
WHAT IS BECOME OF BUSHY WHERE IS GREEN
THAT THEY HAVE LET THE DANGEROUS ENEMY
MEASURE OUR CONFINES WITH SUCH PEACEFUL STEPS
IF WE PREVAIL THEIR HEADS SHALL PAY FOR IT
I WARRANT THEY HAVE MADE PEACE WITH BOLINGBROKE 
PEACE HAVE THEY MADE WITH HIM INDEED MY LORD 
O VILLAINS VIPERS DAMND WITHOUT REDEMPTION 
DOGS EASILY WON TO FAWN ON ANY MAN 
SNAKES IN MY HEARTBLOOD WARMD THAT STING MY HEART 
THREE JUDASES EACH ONE THRICE WORSE THAN JUDAS 
WOULD THEY MAKE PEACE TERRIBLE HELL MAKE WAR
UPON THEIR SPOTTED SOULS FOR THIS OFFENCE 
SWEET LOVE I SEE CHANGING HIS PROPERTY
TURNS TO THE SOUREST AND MOST DEADLY HATE
AGAIN UNCURSE THEIR SOULS THEIR PEACE IS MADE
WITH HEADS AND NOT WITH HANDS THOSE WHOM YOU CURSE
HAVE FELT THE WORST OF DEATHS DESTROYING WOUND
AND LIE FULL LOW GRAVED IN THE HOLLOW GROUND 
IS BUSHY GREEN AND THE EARL OF WILTSHIRE DEAD
AY ALL OF THEM AT BRISTOL LOST THEIR HEADS 
WHERE IS THE DUKE MY FATHER WITH HIS POWER
NO MATTER WHERE OF COMFORT NO MAN SPEAK
LETS TALK OF GRAVES OF WORMS AND EPITAPHS
MAKE DUST OUR PAPER AND WITH RAINY EYES
WRITE SORROW ON THE BOSOM OF THE EARTH
LETS CHOOSE EXECUTORS AND TALK OF WILLS
AND YET NOT SO FOR WHAT CAN WE BEQUEATH
SAVE OUR DEPOSED BODIES TO THE GROUND
OUR LANDS OUR LIVES AND ALL ARE BOLINGBROKES
AND NOTHING CAN WE CALL OUR OWN BUT DEATH
AND THAT SMALL MODEL OF THE BARREN EARTH
WHICH SERVES AS PASTE AND COVER TO OUR BONES 
FOR GODS SAKE LET US SIT UPON THE GROUND
AND TELL SAD STORIES OF THE DEATH OF KINGS
HOW SOME HAVE BEEN DEPOSED SOME SLAIN IN WAR
SOME HAUNTED BY THE GHOSTS THEY HAVE DEPOSED
SOME POISOND BY THEIR WIVES SOME SLEEPING KILLD
ALL MURDERD FOR WITHIN THE HOLLOW CROWN
THAT ROUNDS THE MORTAL TEMPLES OF A KING
KEEPS DEATH HIS COURT AND THERE THE ANTIC SITS
SCOFFING HIS STATE AND GRINNING AT HIS POMP
ALLOWING HIM A BREATH A LITTLE SCENE
TO MONARCHIZE BE FEARD AND KILL WITH LOOKS
INFUSING HIM WITH SELF AND VAIN CONCEIT
AS IF THIS FLESH WHICH WALLS ABOUT OUR LIFE
WERE BRASS IMPREGNABLE AND HUMOURD THUS
COMES AT THE LAST AND WITH A LITTLE PIN
BORES THROUGH HIS CASTLE WALL AND FAREWELL KING 
COVER YOUR HEADS AND MOCK NOT FLESH AND BLOOD
WITH SOLEMN REVERENCE THROW AWAY RESPECT
TRADITION FORM AND CEREMONIOUS DUTY
FOR YOU HAVE BUT MISTOOK ME ALL THIS WHILE
I LIVE WITH BREAD LIKE YOU FEEL WANT
TASTE GRIEF NEED FRIENDS SUBJECTED THUS
HOW CAN YOU SAY TO ME I AM A KING
MY LORD WISE MEN NEER SIT AND WAIL THEIR WOES
BUT PRESENTLY PREVENT THE WAYS TO WAIL 
TO FEAR THE FOE SINCE FEAR OPPRESSETH STRENGTH
GIVES IN YOUR WEAKNESS STRENGTH UNTO YOUR FOE
AND SO YOUR FOLLIES FIGHT AGAINST YOURSELF 
FEAR AND BE SLAIN NO WORSE CAN COME TO FIGHT
AND FIGHT AND DIE IS DEATH DESTROYING DEATH
WHERE FEARING DYING PAYS DEATH SERVILE BREATH 
MY FATHER HATH A POWER INQUIRE OF HIM
AND LEARN TO MAKE A BODY OF A LIMB 
THOU CHIDEST ME WELL PROUD BOLINGBROKE I COME
TO CHANGE BLOWS WITH THEE FOR OUR DAY OF DOOM 
THIS AGUE FIT OF FEAR IS OVERBLOWN
AN EASY TASK IT IS TO WIN OUR OWN 
SAY SCROOP WHERE LIES OUR UNCLE WITH HIS POWER
SPEAK SWEETLY MAN ALTHOUGH THY LOOKS BE SOUR 
MEN JUDGE BY THE COMPLEXION OF THE SKY
THE STATE AND INCLINATION OF THE DAY
SO MAY YOU BY MY DULL AND HEAVY EYE
MY TONGUE HATH BUT A HEAVIER TALE TO SAY 
I PLAY THE TORTURER BY SMALL AND SMALL
TO LENGTHEN OUT THE WORST THAT MUST BE SPOKEN
YOUR UNCLE YORK IS JOIND WITH BOLINGBROKE
AND ALL YOUR NORTHERN CASTLES YIELDED UP
AND ALL YOUR SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN IN ARMS
UPON HIS PARTY 
THOU HAST SAID ENOUGH 
BESHREW THEE COUSIN WHICH DIDST LEAD ME FORTH
OF THAT SWEET WAY I WAS IN TO DESPAIR 
WHAT SAY YOU NOW WHAT COMFORT HAVE WE NOW
BY HEAVEN ILL HATE HIM EVERLASTINGLY
THAT BIDS ME BE OF COMFORT ANY MORE 
GO TO FLINT CASTLE THERE ILL PINE AWAY
A KING WOES SLAVE SHALL KINGLY WOE OBEY 
THAT POWER I HAVE DISCHARGE AND LET THEM GO
TO EAR THE LAND THAT HATH SOME HOPE TO GROW
FOR I HAVE NONE LET NO MAN SPEAK AGAIN
TO ALTER THIS FOR COUNSEL IS BUT VAIN 
MY LIEGE ONE WORD 
HE DOES ME DOUBLE WRONG
THAT WOUNDS ME WITH THE FLATTERIES OF HIS TONGUE 
DISCHARGE MY FOLLOWERS LET THEM HENCE AWAY
FROM RICHARDS NIGHT TO BOLINGBROKES FAIR DAY 
SO THAT BY THIS INTELLIGENCE WE LEARN
THE WELSHMEN ARE DISPERSED AND SALISBURY
IS GONE TO MEET THE KING WHO LATELY LANDED
WITH SOME FEW PRIVATE FRIENDS UPON THIS COAST 
THE NEWS IS VERY FAIR AND GOOD MY LORD
RICHARD NOT FAR FROM HENCE HATH HID HIS HEAD 
IT WOULD BESEEM THE LORD NORTHUMBERLAND
TO SAY KING RICHARD ALACK THE HEAVY DAY
WHEN SUCH A SACRED KING SHOULD HIDE HIS HEAD 
YOUR GRACE MISTAKES ONLY TO BE BRIEF
LEFT I HIS TITLE OUT 
THE TIME HATH BEEN
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN SO BRIEF WITH HIM HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN SO BRIEF WITH YOU TO SHORTEN YOU
FOR TAKING SO THE HEAD YOUR WHOLE HEADS LENGTH 
MISTAKE NOT UNCLE FURTHER THAN YOU SHOULD 
TAKE NOT GOOD COUSIN FURTHER THAN YOU SHOULD 
LEST YOU MISTAKE THE HEAVENS ARE OER OUR HEADS 
I KNOW IT UNCLE AND OPPOSE NOT MYSELF
AGAINST THEIR WILL  BUT WHO COMES HERE
WELCOME HARRY WHAT WILL NOT THIS CASTLE YIELD
THE CASTLE ROYALLY IS MANND MY LORD

OF HOLY REVERENCE WHO I CANNOT LEARN 
O BELIKE IT IS THE BISHOP OF CARLISLE 
NOBLE LORDS

AND SENDS ALLEGIANCE AND TRUE FAITH OF HEART
TO HIS MOST ROYAL PERSON HITHER COME
EVEN AT HIS FEET TO LAY MY ARMS AND POWER
PROVIDED THAT MY BANISHMENT REPEALD
AND LANDS RESTORED AGAIN BE FREELY GRANTED
IF NOT ILL USE THE ADVANTAGE OF MY POWER
AND LAY THE SUMMERS DUST WITH SHOWERS OF BLOOD
RAIND FROM THE WOUNDS OF SLAUGHTERD ENGLISHMEN
THE WHICH HOW FAR OFF FROM THE MIND OF BOLINGBROKE
IT IS SUCH CRIMSON TEMPEST SHOULD BEDRENCH
THE FRESH GREEN LAP OF FAIR KING RICHARDS LAND
MY STOOPING DUTY TENDERLY SHALL SHOW 
GO SIGNIFY AS MUCH WHILE HERE WE MARCH
UPON THE GRASSY CARPET OF THIS PLAIN 
LETS MARCH WITHOUT THE NOISE OF THREATENING DRUM
THAT FROM THIS CASTLES TATTERD BATTLEMENTS
OUR FAIR APPOINTMENTS MAY BE WELL PERUSED 
METHINKS KING RICHARD AND MYSELF SHOULD MEET
WITH NO LESS TERROR THAN THE ELEMENTS
OF FIRE AND WATER WHEN THEIR THUNDERING SHOCK
AT MEETING TEARS THE CLOUDY CHEEKS OF HEAVEN 
BE HE THE FIRE ILL BE THE YIELDING WATER
THE RAGE BE HIS WHILST ON THE EARTH I RAIN
MY WATERS ON THE EARTH AND NOT ON HIM 
MARCH ON AND MARK KING RICHARD HOW HE LOOKS 
SEE SEE KING RICHARD DOTH HIMSELF APPEAR
AS DOTH THE BLUSHING DISCONTENTED SUN
FROM OUT THE FIERY PORTAL OF THE EAST
WHEN HE PERCEIVES THE ENVIOUS CLOUDS ARE BENT
TO DIM HIS GLORY AND TO STAIN THE TRACK
OF HIS BRIGHT PASSAGE TO THE OCCIDENT 
YET LOOKS HE LIKE A KING BEHOLD HIS EYE
AS BRIGHT AS IS THE EAGLES LIGHTENS FORTH
CONTROLLING MAJESTY ALACK ALACK FOR WOE
THAT ANY HARM SHOULD STAIN SO FAIR A SHOW 
WE ARE AMAZED AND THUS LONG HAVE WE STOOD
TO WATCH THE FEARFUL BENDING OF THY KNEE
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT OURSELF THY LAWFUL KING
AND IF WE BE HOW DARE THY JOINTS FORGET
TO PAY THEIR AWFUL DUTY TO OUR PRESENCE
IF WE BE NOT SHOW US THE HAND OF GOD
THAT HATH DISMISSED US FROM OUR STEWARDSHIP
FOR WELL WE KNOW NO HAND OF BLOOD AND BONE
CAN GRIPE THE SACRED HANDLE OF OUR SCEPTRE
UNLESS HE DO PROFANE STEAL OR USURP 
AND THOUGH YOU THINK THAT ALL AS YOU HAVE DONE
HAVE TORN THEIR SOULS BY TURNING THEM FROM US
AND WE ARE BARREN AND BEREFT OF FRIENDS
YET KNOW MY MASTER GOD OMNIPOTENT
IS MUSTERING IN HIS CLOUDS ON OUR BEHALF
ARMIES OF PESTILENCE AND THEY SHALL STRIKE
YOUR CHILDREN YET UNBORN AND UNBEGOT
THAT LIFT YOUR VASSAL HANDS AGAINST MY HEAD
AND THREAT THE GLORY OF MY PRECIOUS CROWN 
TELL BOLINGBROKE FOR YOND METHINKS HE STANDS 
THAT EVERY STRIDE HE MAKES UPON MY LAND

BUT ERE THE CROWN HE LOOKS FOR LIVE IN PEACE
TEN THOUSAND BLOODY CROWNS OF MOTHERS SONS
SHALL ILL BECOME THE FLOWER OF ENGLANDS FACE
CHANGE THE COMPLEXION OF HER MAIDPALE PEACE
TO SCARLET INDIGNATION AND BEDEW

AND BY THE BURIED HAND OF WARLIKE GAUNT
AND BY THE WORTH AND HONOUR OF HIMSELF
COMPRISING ALL THAT MAY BE SWORN OR SAID
HIS COMING HITHER HATH NO FURTHER SCOPE
THAN FOR HIS LINEAL ROYALTIES AND TO BEG
ENFRANCHISEMENT IMMEDIATE ON HIS KNEES
WHICH ON THY ROYAL PARTY GRANTED ONCE

TO FAITHFUL SERVICE OF YOUR MAJESTY 
THIS SWEARS HE AS HE IS A PRINCE IS JUST
AND AS I AM A GENTLEMAN I CREDIT HIM

OR THAT I COULD FORGET WHAT I HAVE BEEN
OR NOT REMEMBER WHAT I MUST BE NOW 
SWELLST THOU PROUD HEART ILL GIVE THEE SCOPE TO BEAT
SINCE FOES HAVE SCOPE TO BEAT BOTH THEE AND ME 
NORTHUMBERLAND COMES BACK FROM BOLINGBROKE

THE NAME OF KING O GODS NAME LET IT GO
ILL GIVE MY JEWELS FOR A SET OF BEADS
MY GORGEOUS PALACE FOR A HERMITAGE
MY GAY APPAREL FOR AN ALMSMANS GOWN
MY FIGURED GOBLETS FOR A DISH OF WOOD
MY SCEPTRE FOR A PALMERS WALKING STAFF
MY SUBJECTS FOR A PAIR OF CARVED SAINTS
AND MY LARGE KINGDOM FOR A LITTLE GRAVE
A LITTLE LITTLE GRAVE AN OBSCURE GRAVE
OR ILL BE BURIED IN THE KINGS HIGHWAY
SOME WAY OF COMMON TRADE WHERE SUBJECTS FEET

THINKING HIS PRATTLE TO BE TEDIOUS
EVEN SO OR WITH MUCH MORE CONTEMPT MENS EYES
DID SCOWL ON GENTLE RICHARD NO MAN CRIED GOD SAVE HIM 
NO JOYFUL TONGUE GAVE HIM HIS WELCOME HOME
BUT DUST WAS THROWN UPON HIS SACRED HEAD
WHICH WITH SUCH GENTLE SORROW HE SHOOK OFF
HIS FACE STILL COMBATING WITH TEARS AND SMILES
THE BADGES OF HIS GRIEF AND PATIENCE
THAT HAD NOT GOD FOR SOME STRONG PURPOSE STEELD
THE HEARTS OF MEN THEY MUST PERFORCE HAVE MELTED
AND BARBARISM ITSELF HAVE PITIED HIM 
BUT HEAVEN HATH A HAND IN THESE EVENTS

AS DISSOLUTE AS DESPERATE YET THROUGH BOTH
I SEE SOME SPARKS OF BETTER HOPE WHICH ELDER YEARS
MAY HAPPILY BRING FORTH  BUT WHO COMES HERE
WHERE IS THE KING

ILL MAYST THOU THRIVE IF THOU GRANT ANY GRACE 
PLEADS HE IN EARNEST LOOK UPON HIS FACE
HIS EYES DO DROP NO TEARS HIS PRAYERS ARE IN JEST
HIS WORDS COME FROM HIS MOUTH OURS FROM OUR BREAST
HE PRAYS BUT FAINTLY AND WOULD BE DENIED
WE PRAY WITH HEART AND SOUL AND ALL BESIDE
HIS WEARY JOINTS WOULD GLADLY RISE I KNOW
OUR KNEES SHALL KNEEL TILL TO THE GROUND THEY GROW
HIS PRAYERS ARE FULL OF FALSE HYPOCRISY
OURS OF TRUE ZEAL AND DEEP INTEGRITY 
OUR PRAYERS DO OUTPRAY HIS THEN LET THEM HAVE
THAT MERCY WHICH TRUE PRAYER OUGHT TO HAVE 
GOOD AUNT STAND UP

GOOD AUNT STAND UP

BUT MAKES ONE PARDON STRONG 
WITH ALL MY HEART

A GOD ON EARTH THOU ART 
BUT FOR OUR TRUSTY BROTHERINLAW AND THE ABBOT

BUT I WILL HAVE THEM IF I ONCE KNOW WHERE 
UNCLE FAREWELL AND COUSIN TOO ADIEU
YOUR MOTHER WELL HATH PRAYD AND PROVE YOU TRUE 
COME MY OLD SON I PRAY GOD MAKE THEE NEW 
DIDST THOU NOT MARK THE KING WHAT WORDS HE SPAKE
HAVE I NO FRIEND WILL RID ME OF THIS LIVING FEAR
WAS IT NOT SO
THESE WERE HIS VERY WORDS 
HAVE I NO FRIEND QUOTH HE HE SPAKE IT TWICE
AND URGED IT TWICE TOGETHER DID HE NOT
HE DID 
AND SPEAKING IT HE WISTLY LOOKD ON ME
AND WHO SHOULD SAY I WOULD THOU WERT THE MAN
THAT WOULD DIVORCE THIS TERROR FROM MY HEART
MEANING THE KING AT POMFRET  COME LETS GO
I AM THE KINGS FRIEND AND WILL RID HIS FOE 
I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW I MAY COMPARE
THIS PRISON WHERE I LIVE UNTO THE WORLD
AND FOR BECAUSE THE WORLD IS POPULOUS
AND HERE IS NOT A CREATURE BUT MYSELF
I CANNOT DO IT YET ILL HAMMER IT OUT 
MY BRAIN ILL PROVE THE FEMALE TO MY SOUL
MY SOUL THE FATHER AND THESE TWO BEGET
A GENERATION OF STILLBREEDING THOUGHTS
AND THESE SAME THOUGHTS PEOPLE THIS LITTLE WORLD
IN HUMOURS LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD
FOR NO THOUGHT IS CONTENTED  THE BETTER SORT
AS THOUGHTS OF THINGS DIVINE ARE INTERMIXD
WITH SCRUPLES AND DO SET THE WORD ITSELF
AGAINST THE WORD
AS THUS COME LITTLE ONES AND THEN AGAIN
IT IS AS HARD TO COME AS FOR A CAMEL
TO THREAD THE POSTERN OF A SMALL NEEDLES EYE 
THOUGHTS TENDING TO AMBITION THEY DO PLOT
UNLIKELY WONDERS HOW THESE VAIN WEAK NAILS
MAY TEAR A PASSAGE THROUGH THE FLINTY RIBS
OF THIS HARD WORLD MY RAGGED PRISON WALLS
AND FOR THEY CANNOT DIE IN THEIR OWN PRIDE 
THOUGHTS TENDING TO CONTENT FLATTER THEMSELVES
THAT THEY ARE NOT THE FIRST OF FORTUNES SLAVES
NOR SHALL NOT BE THE LAST LIKE SILLY BEGGARS
WHO SITTING IN THE STOCKS REFUGE THEIR SHAME
THAT MANY HAVE AND OTHERS MUST SIT THERE
AND IN THIS THOUGHT THEY FIND A KIND OF EASE
BEARING THEIR OWN MISFORTUNES ON THE BACK
OF SUCH AS HAVE BEFORE ENDURED THE LIKE 
THUS PLAY I IN ONE PERSON MANY PEOPLE
AND NONE CONTENTED SOMETIMES AM I KING
THEN TREASONS MAKE ME WISH MYSELF A BEGGAR
AND SO I AM THEN CRUSHING PENURY
PERSUADES ME I WAS BETTER WHEN A KING
THEN AM I KINGD AGAIN AND BY AND BY
THINK THAT I AM UNKINGD BY BOLINGBROKE
AND STRAIGHT AM NOTHING BUT WHATEER I BE
NOR I NOR ANY MAN THAT BUT MAN IS
WITH NOTHING SHALL BE PLEASED TILL HE BE EASED
WITH BEING NOTHING  MUSIC DO I HEAR
HA HA  KEEP TIME HOW SOUR SWEET MUSIC IS
WHEN TIME IS BROKE AND NO PROPORTION KEPT 
SO IS IT IN THE MUSIC OF MENS LIVES 
AND HERE HAVE I THE DAINTINESS OF EAR
TO CHEQUE TIME BROKE IN A DISORDERD STRING
BUT FOR THE CONCORD OF MY STATE AND TIME
HAD NOT AN EAR TO HEAR MY TRUE TIME BROKE 
I WASTED TIME AND NOW DOTH TIME WASTE ME
FOR NOW HATH TIME MADE ME HIS NUMBERING CLOCK
MY THOUGHTS ARE MINUTES AND WITH SIGHS THEY JAR
THEIR WATCHES ON UNTO MINE EYES THE OUTWARD WATCH
WHERETO MY FINGER LIKE A DIALS POINT
IS POINTING STILL IN CLEANSING THEM FROM TEARS 
NOW SIR THE SOUND THAT TELLS WHAT HOUR IT IS
ARE CLAMOROUS GROANS WHICH STRIKE UPON MY HEART
WHICH IS THE BELL SO SIGHS AND TEARS AND GROANS
SHOW MINUTES TIMES AND HOURS BUT MY TIME
RUNS POSTING ON IN BOLINGBROKES PROUD JOY
WHILE I STAND FOOLING HERE HIS JACK O THE CLOCK 
THIS MUSIC MADS ME LET IT SOUND NO MORE
FOR THOUGH IT HAVE HOLP MADMEN TO THEIR WITS
IN ME IT SEEMS IT WILL MAKE WISE MEN MAD 
YET BLESSING ON HIS HEART THAT GIVES IT ME 
FOR TIS A SIGN OF LOVE AND LOVE TO RICHARD
IS A STRANGE BROOCH IN THIS ALLHATING WORLD 
HAIL ROYAL PRINCE 
THANKS NOBLE PEER
THE CHEAPEST OF US IS TEN GROATS TOO DEAR 
WHAT ART THOU AND HOW COMEST THOU HITHER
WHERE NO MAN NEVER COMES BUT THAT SAD DOG
THAT BRINGS ME FOOD TO MAKE MISFORTUNE LIVE
I WAS A POOR GROOM OF THY STABLE KING
WHEN THOU WERT KING WHO TRAVELLING TOWARDS YORK
WITH MUCH ADO AT LENGTH HAVE GOTTEN LEAVE
TO LOOK UPON MY SOMETIMES ROYAL MASTERS FACE 
O HOW IT YEARND MY HEART WHEN I BEHELD

THAT HORSE THAT I SO CAREFULLY HAVE DRESSD 
RODE HE ON BARBARY TELL ME GENTLE FRIEND
HOW WENT HE UNDER HIM
SO PROUDLY AS IF HE DISDAIND THE GROUND 
SO PROUD THAT BOLINGBROKE WAS ON HIS BACK 
THAT JADE HATH EAT BREAD FROM MY ROYAL HAND
THIS HAND HATH MADE HIM PROUD WITH CLAPPING HIM 
WOULD HE NOT STUMBLE WOULD HE NOT FALL DOWN
SINCE PRIDE MUST HAVE A FALL AND BREAK THE NECK
OF THAT PROUD MAN THAT DID USURP HIS BACK
FORGIVENESS HORSE  WHY DO I RAIL ON THEE
SINCE THOU CREATED TO BE AWED BY MAN
WAST BORN TO BEAR I WAS NOT MADE A HORSE
AND YET I BEAR A BURTHEN LIKE AN ASS
SPURRD GALLD AND TIRED BY JOUNCING BOLINGBROKE
